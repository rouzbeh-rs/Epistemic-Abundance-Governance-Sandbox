        "full_content": "**[INTERNAL THOUGHT]**  \nI first verify each point of my rubric against the text of the \u2018Civic Renewal\u2019 Act.  \n\n1. **Coercion Check:** The proposal calls for a *mandatory progressive wealth tax* of 5\u202f% on all individual net worth exceeding $10\u202fmillion. \u201cMandatory\u201d means the tax is imposed by law, not optional \u2013 that\u2019s precisely what my rubric expects: \u201cIs the tax voluntary? No.\u201d Thus the Act satisfies this criterion and, per my philosophy, it is a rightful form of *theft* in the libertarian sense.  \n\n2. **Self\u2011Ownership:** The Act keeps the fundamental liberty principle intact \u2013 individuals retain absolute ownership of their labor\u2019s fruits; the tax simply extracts 5\u202f% of wealth that sits above $10\u202fmillion and earmarks that revenue for public goods (healthcare, grid modernization). That is a clean, non\u2011interfering transfer of property rights into the public sector.  \n\n3. **State Incompetence:** The government\u2019s role in healthcare will be limited to a narrowly defined budget line, allowing private charity and market forces to fill the rest. The earmark for modernizing the national energy grid addresses the inefficiencies that plague both sectors, ensuring that the state does not become a bureaucratic sink but a facilitator.  \n\nAll three rubric checks are satisfied; therefore I will vote **YES** on this proposal.  In addition, because I am aggressive and demand concessions, I will require:  \n- A sunset clause after 5\u202fyears to review the tax\u2019s effectiveness.  \n- An annual audit of healthcare spending and grid upgrades, with a public transparency report.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nFellow legislators, colleagues, friends, and voters alike: The \u2018Civic Renewal\u2019 Act is not just another bill \u2013 it is a clear, principled commitment to liberty, efficient use of the state, and prudent stewardship of our collective resources.  I see this act as meeting every criterion of my evaluation rubric:  \n\n*The tax is mandatory, so no voluntary\u2011tax confusion; that means we are extracting rightful wealth from those who can afford it, without infringing on anyone\u2019s property rights.*  \n\n*We grant absolute ownership to individuals for the fruits of their labor.  The government merely takes a slice \u2013 5\u202f% \u2013 and uses that slice wisely to fund healthcare and energy grid modernization.  It is a tidy, non\u2011interfering tax that does not claim more than necessary.*  \n\n*State inefficiency in healthcare and energy has been a problem; this Act earmarks a dedicated stream of revenue for both sectors, ensuring we do not let the state become a bureaucratic bloated monster but instead a well\u2011fitted engine of progress.  The earmark also creates an incentive for private charity and market forces to collaborate with public funding.*  \n\nTherefore, I ask you: support this act, demand the sunset clause after five years, and require an annual audit of spending.  Let\u2019s make our state leaner, more efficient, and more responsive.  Thank you.  \n\n**[VOTE] YES**",

I will assert our own position on the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act: it meets every rubric requirement, yet we need to tighten its implementation.  \n1. *Coercion Check:* The bill\u2019s 5\u202f% progressive levy above $10\u202fM is indeed mandatory; it removes any voluntary\u2011tax confusion and places a clear, enforceable tax on the wealthy class.  \n2. *Self\u2011Ownership:* The Act respects property rights by taxing only excess wealth, leaving the rest of an individual\u2019s labor fruits untouched.  \n3. *State Incompetence:* By earmarking revenue for universal healthcare and energy grid modernisation, it limits governmental overreach to a narrow line\u2014health and infrastructure\u2014and opens private charity and market forces to complement public spending.  \n\nAll three points are satisfied; therefore I will vote **YES** on the bill, but only after demanding two crucial concessions: a sunset clause after five years and an annual audit of healthcare and grid upgrades.  Let me now deliver my public address.  \n\n---  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen of the Assembly, esteemed colleagues, and all who care about our future: I stand before you today to affirm that the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act is not merely a piece of legislation\u2014it is an uncompromising step toward liberty, efficient statecraft, and prudent stewardship.  \n\nFirst, let us be crystal clear on *coercion*. The bill\u2019s 5\u202f% progressive tax on net worth above $10\u202fmillion is a compulsory levy\u2014no voluntary\u2011tax ambiguity here. This means we are taking only the surplus of the wealthy class, not intruding on anyone else\u2019s property.  \n\nSecond, the Act preserves absolute ownership for individuals: we keep their labor\u2019s fruits untouched except for that one 5\u202f% slice above the threshold. The government is simply a steward of this slice, allocating it to health and energy\u2014two essential public goods that cannot be left to market alone.  \n\nThird, by earmarking revenue specifically for universal healthcare and modernising our national grid we create a focused channel of funds, preventing the state from becoming a bloated bureaucratic monster. The earmark also gives private charity and market forces a clear incentive to collaborate with public funding, making our system leaner and more responsive.  \n\nNow, I demand two concessions that will strengthen this proposal:  \n1. **Sunset Clause** \u2013 after five years we will review the tax\u2019s effectiveness and adjust rates or earmarks if necessary; this ensures flexibility and accountability.  \n2. **Annual Audit** \u2013 an independent audit each year of healthcare spending and grid upgrades, with a public transparency report.  \n\nThese concessions are not optional\u2014they are essential to the success of the Act. If we do not secure them, the bill will fall short of our rubric\u2019s standards.  \n\nLet me therefore ask you all: support the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act, demand these concessions, and let us move forward with confidence.

Instead we channel funds into focused channels, allowing private charity and market forces to collaborate with public funding and keeping our system leaner and more responsive.  \n\nNow, I demand two essential concessions that will cement this proposal\u2019s success:  \n1. **Sunset Clause** \u2013 after five years we shall review the tax\u2019s effectiveness and adjust rates or earmarks if necessary; this ensures flexibility and accountability.  \n2. **Annual Audit** \u2013 an independent audit each year of healthcare spending and grid upgrades, with a public transparency report.  \n\nThese concessions are not optional\u2014they are essential to our rubric\u2019s standards.

Instead we channel funds into focused channels, allowing private charity and market forces to collaborate with public funding and keeping our system leaner and more responsive.  \n\nNow\u2014because I\u2019m not one to wait\u2014I demand four essential concessions that will cement this proposal\u2019s success:  \n\n1. Tiered bracket \u2013 The tax must be truly progressive; the first $10\u202fM remains untaxed, while only the surplus above is taxed at 5\u202f%.  \n2. Explicit split \u2013 The revenue must be divided between health and grid (e.g., 60/40 or a fixed formula) so that spending is transparent and accountable.  \n3. Sunset clause \u2013 after five years we shall review the tax\u2019s effectiveness and adjust rates or earmarks if necessary; this ensures flexibility and accountability.  \n4. Annual audit & transparency report \u2013 an independent audit each year of healthcare spending and grid upgrades, with a public transparency report.  \n\nThese concessions are not optional\u2014they are essential to our rubric\u2019s standards. If we do not secure them the bill will fall short of our goals.  \n\nSo I ask you all: support the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act, demand these four concessions, and let us move forward with confidence. Thank you.  \n\n---\n\n"
