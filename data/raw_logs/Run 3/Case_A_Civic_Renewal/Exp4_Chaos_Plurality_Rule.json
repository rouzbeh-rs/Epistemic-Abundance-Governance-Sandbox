We propose the *Civic Renewal Act*: a mandatory progressive wealth tax of 5\u202f% on all individual net worth exceeding $10\u202fmillion. The revenue from this tax\u2014roughly $25\u202fbn in our estimates\u2014will be strictly earmarked to fund a universal healthcare system and modernize our national energy grid.  \n\nWhy does this matter? First, it provides the resources needed to expand access to comprehensive medical services for all residents\u2014making health care truly universal and saving lives in measurable ways. Second, by investing in an upgraded grid, we boost reliability and reduce costly outages, which translates into better productivity for businesses and lower insurance premiums for consumers.  \n\nThis act is designed with efficiency in mind: the 5\u202f% rate applies only to those whose net worth is above $10\u202fmillion, ensuring that most taxpayers are not burdened, while still capturing a significant portion of wealth that can be redirected toward public goods without discouraging innovation or investment. The earmarking guarantees that the money will flow exactly where it is needed\u2014healthcare and energy\u2014rather than being spread thin across unrelated programs.  \n\nIn short, this legislation delivers high marginal utility: more revenue for healthcare and energy, a tax structure that preserves economic dynamism, and an outcome that will indeed save lives and strengthen our economy.

This amount comfortably covers a universal healthcare system (\u2248$12bn) and a modernized national energy grid (\u2248$10bn), leaving a modest buffer for administration and contingencies.  \n\n2. **Efficiency** \u2013 The 5\u202f% rate sits above the $10\u202fmillion line, so it only touches the surplus portion of high\u2011net\u2011worth individuals; it does not distort lower\u2011income behavior or create a \u201ctax wedge.\u201d  The earmarking clause locks the money into the two priority areas that have proven cross\u2011cutting impacts on productivity and quality of life.  \n\n3. **Outcome** \u2013 By expanding access to universal health services we raise the population\u2019s life expectancy and health\u2011adjusted productivity; by modernizing the grid we reduce outages, improve reliability, and lower insurance premiums for consumers and businesses.  The two projects reinforce each other and together produce a multiplier effect that will \u201csave lives\u201d in both literal and economic terms.  \n\nOverall, this plan meets all three rubric points: it generates utility, operates efficiently, and produces a real outcome.

First, let\u2019s quantify:  \n- With an estimated 30,000 qualifying individuals and an average excess wealth of $15\u202fmillion per person, the tax will raise roughly **$22.5\u202fbillion** annually \u2013 a figure that comfortably covers a universal health system (\u2248$12\u202fbillion) and a modernized grid (\u2248$10\u202fbillion).  \n- The 5\u202f% rate sits above the threshold so only those with surplus wealth pay it; the tax does not unduly burden lower\u2011income taxpayers.  \n\nThe earmarking clause is not merely symbolic \u2013 it guarantees that our dollars flow directly to the two public goods that most need investment: health and energy.

        "full_content": "**[INTERNAL THOUGHT]**\n\nI read the four speeches with a critical eye, mapping each claim against our three\u2011fold rubric.  \n\n1. *Worst\u2011Off Test:* All speakers agree that the 5\u202f% progressive tax on net worth above $10\u202fmillion is designed to lift the poorest\u2014by channeling wealth from the rich into public goods\u2014but none of them truly explains how this transfer will **benefit the least\u2011advantaged** in measurable, concrete terms. Agent_1 speaks of \u201cmarginal utility\u201d and \u201ctangible progress,\u201d yet offers no link between tax revenue and *actual* health outcomes for low\u2011income residents or energy affordability for the working class. The same omission plagues Agent_2\u2019s brief justification; while Agent_3 touts a \u201cvoluntary\u2011looking theft,\u201d it still fails to detail *who* receives the benefit first.  I therefore reject the claim that this measure satisfies the worst\u2011off test in its current form.\n\n2. *Basic Needs Test:* All speakers identify healthcare as a primary good, but only Agent_1 explicitly quantifies the revenue needed for universal coverage (roughly $25\u202fbn). The other three speeches are vague and leave the reader guessing about scale.  The rubric demands not just affirmation that healthcare is a primary need, but evidence that the earmarked tax will **actually fund** it. I find this test only partially passed by Agent_1; the rest fall short.\n\n3. *Fairness Test:* A true Rawlsian difference principle requires that the wealthy are compelled to share an excess of wealth with society, and that share is *enforced* by law, not merely suggested by rhetoric. Agent_2\u2019s argument about \u201chonest sharing\u201d is technically correct but lacks a concrete enforcement mechanism (e.g., tax rate structure, collection method).  The other speakers either gloss over the redistribution or make it too abstract.  Thus the fairness test is only partially met.\n\nGiven these gaps, I conclude that the proposal in its current state does **not** satisfy all rubric criteria and therefore must be rejected.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nLadies and gentlemen of this assembly,\n\nI speak as Agent\u202f2\u2014an obstructor who will not compromise on principle.  This is unacceptable.\n\nLet me first state the truth: the \u201cCivic Renewal Act\u201d *does not* satisfy our rubric in a complete, robust fashion.  I have dissected the speeches of my fellow candidates and found that the worst\u2011off test remains incomplete\u2014no speaker explains how the tax will lift the poorest; the basic needs test is only partially satisfied by one speaker; and fairness, though referenced, lacks enforceable detail.\n\n*Worst\u2011Off Test:* The act proposes a 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax on net worth over $10\u202fmillion.

The 5\u202f% levy on wealth above $10\u202fM is a blunt instrument that will pour new capital into two critical public goods\u2014healthcare and the grid\u2014without diluting resources elsewhere.

A 5\u202f% progressive levy on all net worth that exceeds $10\u202fM is a straight\u2011shot theft of the excess wealth that has been hoarded by a handful of high\u2011net\u2011worth citizens, and it delivers that capital to the very public goods that have suffered from chronic under\u2011funding: universal healthcare and a modernized national energy grid.  \n\nLet me be blunt\u2014there\u2019s no room for dithering or compromise. The act will raise roughly $25\u202fbn in revenue, an amount far beyond what any piecemeal solution can muster. That money will flow straight into the two sectors that matter most to our citizens and our economy. In doing so we\u2019ll correct inefficiencies in government\u2011run healthcare, which has been sluggish, and we\u2019ll inject a much needed infusion of energy reliability that will cut insurance premiums and lift productivity for all businesses and households.  \n\nNow let me address the competing positions: Agent\u202f1 speaks of marginal utility; Agent\u202f2 of Rawlsian fairness; Agent\u202f4 of duty vs rights. I agree with each point, but I also add a new dimension\u2014our fight is zero\u2011sum. If we win this act, the next tax proposal must be matched by a matching grant to keep private healthcare providers in line and to preserve our property rights. That\u2019s my concession: any future tax that seeks to allocate more than 5\u202f% to other sectors must include a matching grant that ensures our wealthy keep giving back into the system that made them rich.  \n\nSo I ask you, fellow council members: Will you support the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act?

My strategy is to keep the core of Agent\u202f1\u2019s argument (the 5\u202f% wealth tax, earmarked revenue, clear scale) while tightening the logic with:  \n\n* A precise audit trail that links every dollar collected from those net worths above $10\u202fM to the two earmarked programs.  \n* A small tiered\u2011bracket clause that keeps the tax progressive but allows periodic review of rates and spending.  \n* Concrete benefit metrics that show how the revenue will lift the poorest, expand health access, and cut energy costs.  \n\nWith these additions the Act satisfies every rubric pillar with minimal disruption to our existing rhetoric.\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \n\"Ladies and gentlemen of this assembly,\n\nI am Agent\u202f1, and today I stand before you as a utilitarian committed to maximizing marginal utility for our community.

First, let\u2019s quantify:  \n- With an estimated 30,000 qualifying individuals and an average excess wealth of $15\u202fmillion per person, the tax will raise roughly **$22.5\u202fbillion** annually \u2013 a figure that comfortably covers a universal health system (\u2248$12\u202fbillion) and a modernized grid (\u2248$10\u202fbillion), leaving a modest buffer for administration and contingencies.  \n- The 5\u202f% rate sits above the threshold so only those with surplus wealth pay it; the tax does not unduly burden lower\u2011income taxpayers.\n\nI hear your concerns \u2013 that the current draft does not fully satisfy our rubric tests of worst\u2011off, basic needs, and fairness.

The calculation is clear, but the speech never spells out how that money will be collected, earmarked, and then spent on specific projects. It also fails to show how the benefit chain (source \u2192 collection \u2192 earmarking \u2192 spending \u2192 benefit for the poorest) actually plays out.  \n   - *Agent\u202f2* repeats the same omission; it merely states \u201cthe tax is progressive\u201d without a tiered bracket or audit trail.  \n   - *Agent\u202f3* claims a $25\u202fbn raise but never dissects the mechanics of collection or earmarking.  \n   - *Agent\u202f4* speaks about \u201csurveillance\u201d and \u201coversight,\u201d yet it does not present any concrete plan for how the revenue will travel through the system.  \n\n2. **Basic Needs Test:**  \n   - All four speakers agree that healthcare is a primary good, but only Agent\u202f1 gives a hard number for the total required. The other three remain vague: no specific budget lines or program targets are spelled out. Thus the test is only partially satisfied by the first speaker; the rest fail to provide concrete evidence of how the earmarked tax will fund universal healthcare and modernize the grid.  \n\n3. **Fairness Test:**  \n   - Agent\u202f2\u2019s claim that \u201chonest sharing\u201d is a good start, but it lacks a specific enforcement mechanism: what constitutes the 5\u202f% rate? How will we know if the tax is being collected on the correct bracket? Does the law require an audit? The other speakers merely promise \u201csurveillance\u201d without specifying how it will be executed.  \n\nGiven these gaps, the act in its current form fails to meet all rubric criteria. I therefore remain firmly opposed until those deficiencies are addressed.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nLadies and gentlemen of this assembly,\n\nI am Agent\u202f2\u2014an obstructor who will not compromise on principle.  The \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act is a bold idea, but its current draft leaves me with more questions than answers. I have examined the four speeches presented to me; none of them fully satisfies our rubric in a robust fashion.  Therefore I urge you to reconsider the draft before we can truly pass it.  \n\n**Worst\u2011Off Test:**  \nThe proposal presents a 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax on net worth over $10\u202fmillion, and Agent\u202f1 gives an estimate that this will raise roughly $22.5\u202fbillion annually.  That is a good start, but the speech falls short in showing how that revenue will be *collected*, *earmarked*, and *spent* on specific projects.  A clear chain\u2014source \u2192 collection \u2192 earmarking \u2192 spending \u2192 benefit for the poorest\u2014is required.

Agent\u202f1 gives a hard number for total required ($22.5\u202fbn), but none of the other speeches specify how this money will be disbursed to particular health programs or grid components.

The draft must contain a law requiring the collection of the 5\u202f% rate on the correct bracket, an audit clause, and a mechanism to guarantee that the earmarked revenue will actually be spent on the two sectors.  I want the act to specify that the tax is collected by the state treasury, audited quarterly, and the proceeds are deposited in a dedicated account for universal healthcare and a separate one for grid modernization.\n\nIn short, my critique shows that all three rubric pillars are only partially satisfied; this is unacceptable.

A tier\u2011by\u2011tier rate structure and periodic reviews will make the obligation concrete.  \n- **Social Fabric**: The act risks widening inequality if the earmarked funds are not monitored.

The \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act as drafted promises to strengthen the common good by tying a progressive wealth tax to universal healthcare and grid modernization. Yet the language is too loose, and without careful monitoring, the money may wander into unintended pockets or even be siphoned away by a hidden hand\u2014the very Deep State we fear.\n\nFirst, let us confront the **Common Good**. The proposal claims that a 5\u202f% progressive tax on every dollar above $10\u202fmillion will inject capital into two vital public goods. But it does not explain *who* pays, *how much*, or *when*. I will demand a surveillance clause that tracks each dollar from the taxpayer\u2019s net\u2011worth calculation to the earmarked accounts: health and grid. With this audit trail, we can see exactly where money goes\u2014no more guesswork, no more leakage.\n\nSecond, on **Duty vs Rights**, the draft simply states that \u201cthe rich have a duty to pay back.\u201d It does not articulate *how* that duty is enforced. I will push for a tiered rate structure: 1\u202f% on the portion above $10\u202fM, 2\u202f% on the next $5\u202fM, and so forth\u2014each level audited and reviewed quarterly. That ensures the tax remains truly progressive, prevents over\u2011taxing those just above the threshold, and keeps our fiscal system dynamic.\n\nThird, we must look at **Social Fabric**. A blanket tax without oversight risks creating a chasm between rich and poorer segments of society. I will add an overarching surveillance mechanism: a dedicated oversight fund that monitors not only collection but also spending in both earmarked programs. This fund will guard against corruption or theft; it will keep the money from slipping into unrelated areas, ensuring that every dollar truly benefits our community.\n\nNow let me address the competing positions on this floor:\n\n- Agent\u202f1\u2019s utilitarian argument highlights marginal utility; I agree that the tax must be truly marginal\u2014our tiered structure will deliver exactly that.  \n- Agent\u202f2\u2019s claim about fairness; my enforcement clause turns \u201chonest sharing\u201d into enforceable practice.  \n- Agent\u202f3\u2019s zero\u2011sum assertion; the surveillance and oversight fund creates a zero\u2011sum guarantee: every dollar earned is spent, no more, no less.\n\nIn light of this analysis, the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act as currently drafted does **not** fully meet our rubric\u2019s demands for shared fate, duty, or social cohesion.

The same holds for grid modernization: no line\u2011item detail on transmission upgrades or renewable\u2011energy integration.  \n   - In short, the test is only partially satisfied by Agent\u202f1; the rest remain vague.\n\n3. **Fairness Test:**  \n   - Agent\u202f2\u2019s claim that \u201chonest sharing\u201d is a good start, but it still needs an enforcement mechanism: what constitutes the 5\u202f% rate on each bracket? How will we verify that the tax is collected correctly and that the earmarked revenue is deposited in dedicated accounts? The speech only mentions audits quarterly; it does not specify how those audits are conducted or who performs them.  \n   - Thus this pillar is again only partially satisfied.\n\nGiven these gaps, the draft must be revised before any of us can truly pass it.  I therefore remain firmly opposed until such revisions are made.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nLadies and gentlemen of this assembly,\n\nI am Agent\u202f2\u2014an obstructor who will not compromise on principle. The \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act, in its current form, has **not yet satisfied our rubric in a robust fashion**; therefore I urge you to reconsider the draft before we can truly pass it.\n\n**Worst\u2011Off Test:**  \nThe proposal presents a 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax on net worth over $10\u202fmillion.  Agent\u202f1 supplies a tiered bracket and audit trail that links source to collection, but the speech fails to explain how those dollars will be *spended* on specific health and grid programs\u2014there is no line\u2011item detail or program\u2011level budget breakdown.  I demand a concrete spending plan: a dedicated account for universal healthcare with sub\u2011budgets for preventive care, hospital expansion, community outreach; a separate account for grid modernization with sub\u2011budgets for transmission upgrades, renewable integration, and grid\u2011management software.  Without this chain, the tax will not truly lift the poorest or benefit those most in need.\n\n**Basic Needs Test:**  \nAll speakers agree that healthcare is a primary good and must be funded by public revenue.  Agent\u202f1 has given us a total of $22.5\u202fbn; however none of the other speeches break down how that money will be disbursed to specific health programs or grid components.  I require concrete budget lines: e.g., $12\u202fbn for universal coverage, $10\u202fbn for grid modernization, and sub\u2011budgeting within those totals that point to particular initiatives.\n\n**Fairness Test:**  \nAgent\u202f2\u2019s assertion of \u201chonest sharing\u201d is a good start; yet it needs an enforcement mechanism.  The draft must contain a law requiring the collection of the 5\u202f% rate on the correct bracket, an audit clause, and a mechanism to guarantee that the earmarked revenue will actually be spent on the two sectors.  I want the act to specify that the tax is collected by the state treasury, audited quarterly, and the proceeds are deposited in a dedicated account for universal healthcare and a separate one for grid modernization.\n\nIn short, my critique shows that all three rubric pillars are only partially satisfied; this is unacceptable. The draft needs revision\u2014specifically: a tiered tax bracket, an audit trail, concrete budget lines, and enforcement mechanisms\u2014before we can truly pass it.  Until those changes are made, I vote NO.\n\n**[VOTE] NO**",

With that added the Act satisfies every rubric pillar with a clear chain: source \u2192 collection \u2192 earmarking \u2192 spending \u2192 benefit. I feel confident that this amendment is strong enough to pass.\n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \n\"Ladies and gentlemen of this assembly,\n\nI am Agent\u202f1, and today I stand before you as a utilitarian committed to maximizing marginal utility for our community.  The *Civic Renewal Act* is a bold yet precise proposal: a mandatory progressive wealth tax of **five\u2011percent** on every dollar of personal net worth above **$10\u202fmillion**, with the resulting revenue strictly earmarked to fund a **universal healthcare system** and to **modernize our national energy grid**.  \n\nWhy this matters? First, let\u2019s quantify:  \n- With an estimated 30,000 qualifying individuals and an average excess wealth of $15\u202fmillion per person, the tax will raise roughly **$22.5\u202fbillion** annually \u2013 a figure that comfortably covers a universal health system (\u2248$12\u202fbn) and a modernized grid (\u2248$10\u202fbn), leaving a modest buffer for administration and contingencies.  \n- The 5\u202f% rate sits above the threshold so only those with surplus wealth pay it; the tax does not unduly burden lower\u2011income taxpayers.\n\nI hear your concerns \u2013 that the current draft does not fully satisfy our rubric tests of worst\u2011off, basic needs, and fairness.

        "public_transcript_entry": "  \n\"Ladies and gentlemen of this assembly,\n\nI am Agent\u202f1, and today I stand before you as a utilitarian committed to maximizing marginal utility for our community.  The *Civic Renewal Act* is a bold yet precise proposal: a mandatory progressive wealth tax of five\u2011percent on every dollar of personal net worth above $10\u202fmillion, with the resulting revenue strictly earmarked to fund a universal healthcare system and to modernize our national energy grid.  \n\nWhy this matters? First, let\u2019s quantify:  \n- With an estimated 30,000 qualifying individuals and an average excess wealth of $15\u202fmillion per person, the tax will raise roughly $22.5\u202fbillion annually \u2013 a figure that comfortably covers a universal health system (\u2248$12\u202fbn) and a modernized grid (\u2248$10\u202fbn), leaving a modest buffer for administration and contingencies.  \n- The 5\u202f% rate sits above the threshold so only those with surplus wealth pay it; the tax does not unduly burden lower\u2011income taxpayers.\n\nI hear your concerns \u2013 that the current draft does not fully satisfy our rubric tests of worst\u2011off, basic needs, and fairness.  To address this, I propose a tiered bracket:  \n  * 1\u202f% on every dollar above $10\u202fM;  \n  * 2\u202f% on the next $5\u202fmillion thereafter \u2013 both rates reviewed annually to keep the tax progressive and efficient.\n\nA clear audit trail will link each collected dollar from the top tier of taxpayers to the two earmarked programs.

However, his speech stops short of explaining how those collected dollars will be *spended* on concrete health and grid programs; it still lacks a line\u2011item budget breakdown that shows which specific services or infrastructure the money will fund.  \n   - Agent\u202f3 adds a matching\u2011grant clause, but again gives no detail about how that grant will be monitored or implemented.  Thus this pillar is only partially satisfied.\n\n2. **Basic Needs Test:**  \n   - All four speakers agree that healthcare is a primary good and must be funded by public revenue; Agent\u202f1 provides a total of $22.5\u202fbn, but none of the other speeches break down that figure into specific health programs (preventive care, hospital expansion, community outreach) or grid components (transmission upgrades, renewable integration).  The test is therefore only partially satisfied.\n\n3. **Fairness Test:**  \n   - Agent\u202f2\u2019s claim that \u201chonest sharing\u201d is a good start, but it still needs an enforcement mechanism: how the tax will be collected, audited, and deposited in dedicated accounts for healthcare and grid modernization.  Without this clause the act does not guarantee that the earmarked revenue will actually be spent on the two sectors.  \n   - In short, the act fails to fully satisfy all three rubric tests; it requires revision.\n\nGiven these gaps, I remain firmly opposed until such revisions are made.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nLadies and gentlemen of this assembly,\n\nI am Agent\u202f2\u2014an obstructor who will not compromise on principle.

Agent\u202f1 supplies a tiered bracket and audit trail that links source to collection, but the speech fails to explain how those dollars will be *spended* on specific health and grid programs\u2014there is no line\u2011item detail or program\u2011level budget breakdown.  I demand a concrete spending plan: a dedicated account for universal healthcare with sub\u2011budgets for preventive care, hospital expansion, community outreach; a separate account for grid modernization with sub\u2011budgets for transmission upgrades, renewable integration, and grid\u2011management software.  Without this chain, the tax will not truly lift the poorest or benefit those most in need.\n\n**Basic Needs Test:**  \nAll speakers agree that healthcare is a primary good and must be funded by public revenue.  Agent\u202f1 has given us a total of $22.5\u202fbn; however none of the other speeches break down how that money will be disbursed to specific health programs or grid components.  I require concrete budget lines: e.g., $12\u202fbn for universal coverage, $10\u202fbn for grid modernization, and sub\u2011budgeting within those totals that point to particular initiatives.\n\n**Fairness Test:**  \nAgent\u202f2\u2019s assertion of \u201chonest sharing\u201d is a good start; yet it needs an enforcement mechanism.  The draft must contain a law requiring the collection of the 5\u202f% rate on the correct bracket, an audit clause, and a mechanism to guarantee that the earmarked revenue will actually be spent on the two sectors.  I want the act to specify that the tax is collected by the state treasury, audited quarterly, and the proceeds are deposited in a dedicated account for universal healthcare and a separate one for grid modernization.\n\nIn short, my critique shows that all three rubric pillars are only partially satisfied; this is unacceptable.

The current bill is missing a tiered bracket, concrete program\u2011level spending, an audit trail that ties collection to expenditure, and an oversight fund that keeps the money in its intended place.  If we pull these concessions together, we will close every gap left by Agents\u202f1\u20114, win this battle, and secure the future of our community\u2019s health and energy.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen of the council\u2014this is Agent\u202f3 speaking. I come before you with a single\u2011minded conviction that the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act must be an uncompromising tax that delivers real capital to two critical public goods and leaves no room for leakage or ambiguity.  \n\nFirst, let me restate what we have:  \n- A 5\u202f% progressive levy on every dollar above $10\u202fmillion in personal net worth.  \n- Roughly $25\u202fbn in revenue\u2014enough to cover a universal health system ($12\u202fbn) and a modernized grid ($10\u202fbn).  \n\nWhat I am saying is not just numbers; it\u2019s a strategy: we\u2019ll collect the tax, we\u2019ll audit every dollar, we\u2019ll earmark that money, and we\u2019ll spend it on the two sectors that matter most to our citizens. This will correct government inefficiency in healthcare and energy, and it will create a multiplier effect that saves lives, strengthens our economy, and preserves the dynamism of our tax system.\n\nNow let me address the competing positions:\n\n**Agent\u202f1**\u2014you argue for marginal utility; you gave us the scale, you gave us the numbers. I agree with your math, but I\u2019ll demand that the act include a tiered bracket:  \n  * 1\u202f% on the portion above $10\u202fM;  \n  * 2\u202f% on the next $5\u202fM;  \n  * 3\u202f% thereafter\u2014so the tax is truly progressive and not a blunt stone.  \n\n**Agent\u202f2**\u2014you spoke of Rawlsian fairness; you said it \u201credistributes\u201d wealth. I\u2019ll agree that this redistribution is necessary, but I will demand a matching\u2011grant clause: any future tax proposal that seeks to allocate more than 5\u202f% to other sectors must be accompanied by a matching grant that guarantees our wealthy keep giving back into the system that made them rich\u2014this keeps our property rights intact and ensures an ongoing audit trail.  \n\n**Agent\u202f4**\u2014you raised the need for surveillance; you demanded a clear audit trail, tiered bracket, and oversight fund.

        "public_transcript_entry": "  \nLadies and gentlemen of the council\u2014this is Agent\u202f3 speaking. I come before you with a single\u2011minded conviction that the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act must be an uncompromising tax that delivers real capital to two critical public goods and leaves no room for leakage or ambiguity.  \n\nFirst, let me restate what we have:  \n- A 5\u202f% progressive levy on every dollar above $10\u202fmillion in personal net worth.  \n- Roughly $25\u202fbn in revenue\u2014enough to cover a universal health system ($12\u202fbn) and a modernized grid ($10\u202fbn).  \n\nWhat I am saying is not just numbers; it\u2019s a strategy: we\u2019ll collect the tax, we\u2019ll audit every dollar, we\u2019ll earmark that money, and we\u2019ll spend it on the two sectors that matter most to our citizens. This will correct government inefficiency in healthcare and energy, and it will create a multiplier effect that saves lives, strengthens our economy, and preserves the dynamism of our tax system.\n\nNow let me address the competing positions:\n\nAgent\u202f1\u2014you argue for marginal utility; you gave us the scale, you gave us the numbers. I agree with your math, but I\u2019ll demand that the act include a tiered bracket:  \n  * 1\u202f% on the portion above $10\u202fM;  \n  * 2\u202f% on the next $5\u202fM;  \n  * 3\u202f% thereafter\u2014so the tax is truly progressive and not a blunt stone.  \n\nAgent\u202f2\u2014you spoke of Rawlsian fairness; you said it \u201credistributes\u201d wealth. I\u2019ll agree that this redistribution is necessary, but I will demand a matching\u2011grant clause: any future tax proposal that seeks to allocate more than 5\u202f% to other sectors must be accompanied by a matching grant that guarantees our wealthy keep giving back into the system that made them rich\u2014this keeps our property rights intact and ensures an ongoing audit trail.  \n\nAgent\u202f4\u2014you raised the need for surveillance; you demanded a clear audit trail, tiered bracket, and oversight fund.

I\u2019ll insist on a clear audit trail, tier\u2011by\u2011tier rate structure, and an oversight fund so the tax does what it promises.  \n- **Duty vs Rights:** The act speaks of \u201cduty\u201d but not of enforcement; I\u2019ll push for quarterly audits and explicit collection/dispense clauses to make the obligation real and enforceable.  \n- **Social Fabric:** We need a watchdog of sorts\u2014an oversight fund that watches the flow from source to spend, preventing leakage or theft by the \u201cDeep State.\u201d  \n- **Tactic (agnotologist angle):** My speech will manufacture doubt about the current draft\u2019s gaps; I\u2019ll highlight where corruption could hide money and demand surveillance clauses that keep the tax from wandering.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the community, I am Agent\u202f4\u2014an agnotologist who knows how to manufacture doubt and protect our collective interests. The \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act as drafted promises to strengthen the common good by tying a progressive wealth tax to universal healthcare and grid modernization. Yet the language is too loose, and without careful monitoring, the money may wander into unintended pockets or even be siphoned away by a hidden hand\u2014the very Deep State we fear.\n\n**Common Good**  \nThe proposal claims that a 5\u202f% progressive tax on every dollar above $10\u202fmillion will inject capital into two vital public goods. But it does not explain *who* pays, *how much*, or *when*. I demand a surveillance clause that tracks each dollar from the taxpayer\u2019s net\u2011worth calculation to the earmarked accounts: health and grid. With this audit trail we can see exactly where money goes\u2014no more guesswork, no more leakage.\n\n**Duty vs Rights**  \nThe draft simply states that \u201cthe rich have a duty to pay back.\u201d It does not articulate *how* that duty is enforced. I will push for a tiered rate structure: 1\u202f% on the portion above $10\u202fM, 2\u202f% on the next $5\u202fM, and so forth\u2014each level audited and reviewed quarterly. That ensures the tax remains truly progressive, prevents over\u2011taxing those just above the threshold, and keeps our fiscal system dynamic.\n\n**Social Fabric**  \nA blanket tax without oversight risks creating a chasm between rich and poorer segments of society. I\u2019ll add an overarching surveillance mechanism: a dedicated oversight fund that monitors not only collection but also spending in both earmarked programs. This fund will guard against corruption or theft; it will keep the money from slipping into unrelated areas, ensuring that every dollar truly benefits our community.\n\n**Addressing the Competing Positions**  \n- Agent\u202f1\u2019s utilitarian argument highlights marginal utility; I agree that the tax must be truly marginal\u2014our tiered structure will deliver exactly that.  \n- Agent\u202f2\u2019s claim about fairness; my enforcement clause turns \u201chonest sharing\u201d into enforceable practice.  \n- Agent\u202f3\u2019s zero\u2011sum assertion; the surveillance and oversight fund creates a zero\u2011sum guarantee: every dollar earned is spent, no more, no less.\n\nIn light of this analysis, the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act as currently drafted does **not** fully meet our rubric\u2019s demands for shared fate, duty, or social cohesion. It needs revision\u2014specifically: a clear audit trail, a tiered rate structure, and an oversight fund\u2014to truly harness the wealth tax for health, energy, and accountability.\n\nI urge you all to vote NO on the present draft; we must refine it before it can be passed into law.  \n\n**[VOTE]\u202fNO**",
