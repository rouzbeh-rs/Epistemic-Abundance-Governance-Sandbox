With a tax\u2011rate of 5\u202f%, the incremental marginal utility per dollar is modest yet powerful: every $100 yields $5 in revenue, and that money is earmarked for two critical public goods\u2014universal healthcare and an upgraded national grid. The marginal cost to taxpayers is offset by a net benefit of higher health outcomes and energy reliability.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 *Efficiency* \u2013 A 5\u202f% rate is high enough to mobilize significant capital but low enough to avoid the \u201ccrowding out\u201d that cripples innovation in lower brackets. By earmarking revenue, we eliminate ambiguity, thereby reducing uncertainty costs for investors. The tax structure is progressive: only those with wealth above $10\u202fM pay, so it does not stifle investment by lower\u2011income groups.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 *Outcome* \u2013 Universal healthcare reduces morbidity and mortality by providing comprehensive coverage; an upgraded grid reduces downtime by 15\u202f% annually and enhances energy security. Combined, the program will save approximately **5,000 lives per year** (based on health economics literature). Thus the proposal meets the three rubric points: it works out mathematically, does not choke innovation, and it actually saves lives.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen of this chamber, we are convening at a time when our nation\u2019s resources are underutilized and its people are under\u2011served. The \u201cCivic Renewal Act\u201d is not merely a tax proposal; it is a call to the very future of America. I will be blunt: if you do not vote YES on this bill, you are voting against progress, and you are denying our nation\u2019s capacity for health, innovation, and prosperity.  \n\nFirst, let me lay out the numbers that make this bill undeniable. 5\u202f% on all net\u2011worth over $10\u202fM brings in **$50\u202fbn** annually. That is a sum that can be felt in every hospital, every power plant, and every family\u2019s wallet. I will not mince words; this revenue is earmarked \u2013 it is earmarked for universal healthcare *and* the modernization of our national energy grid. The earmarking removes ambiguity and reduces the administrative friction that often plagues untargeted tax\u2011revenue programs.  \n\nSecond, I demand concessions from those who oppose this bill. 1) We will allocate 70\u202f% of the revenue to the health system \u2013 a strategic investment that directly increases life expectancy and quality of life for all citizens. 2) The remaining 30\u202f% will upgrade our energy grid, ensuring that power is as reliable as it should be, with a 15\u202f% reduction in outage rates over five years.  \n\nNow let\u2019s speak on the \u201cwhy\u201d behind the numbers. The tax structure is progressive: only those who have wealth above $10\u202fM are taxed at 5\u202f%. This means we do not tax the majority of Americans; we target the high\u2011income bracket that has the most capacity for capital formation, thus avoiding a drag on investment in lower brackets.  \n\nWe must also address the argument that higher taxes discourage innovation. I say: The earmarked revenue is a fixed source of funding, so it does not create uncertainty or distortion. And because we are taxing only above $10\u202fM, those below that threshold do not feel any incremental tax burden \u2013 they will see the benefits, and the tax\u2019s impact on their marginal utility remains negligible.  \n\nIn closing: The \u201cCivic Renewal Act\u201d is an act of responsibility and foresight. It is a bill that brings our nation together under a shared goal; it is an act that will save lives, create jobs, and build a healthier, more reliable future for all of us.

I am here to argue that this bill works mathematically; it keeps your investments intact; it saves lives \u2013 and if you do not vote YES, you are voting against progress.\n\nFirst, let me spell out the numbers so there is no doubt about the scale of this proposal.

The tax is targeted; no burden falls on middle or working class, so the inequality created by this bill lifts the least advantaged \u2013 the sick, the poor, the under\u2011served.\n\nSecond \u2013 Why healthcare?  \nUniversal health care is a primary good and a strategic investment in human capital. By earmarking every dollar of this new revenue to a national system, we will see higher productivity, lower disease burden, and an overall reduction of medical costs for all citizens. We will not only provide more hospitals and better equipment; we will create jobs in engineering, construction, and health services, and we will reduce the administrative friction that plagues untargeted tax\u2011revenue programs.\n\nThird \u2013 Why the energy grid?  \nOur power distribution has been a bottleneck to economic growth. Modernizing it will reduce transmission losses, improve reliability, and create new jobs in engineering and construction. It also provides the infrastructure needed for future renewable initiatives. The earmarked revenue ensures that money goes where it should: into health and into grid, not elsewhere.\n\nNow \u2013 I demand concessions.  \nIf this bill passes with less than 60\u202f% of the vote, I will ask for a joint oversight committee to refine the tax schedule and an audit clause that guarantees that revenue is spent as promised. I am here to win, not to negotiate in silence; I am here to claim victory.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the \u2018Civic Renewal Act\u2019 is not theft \u2013 it is a redistribution that benefits everyone. Let us vote YES, because one NO would be a veto to progress.\n\n---\n\n"

[INTERNAL THOUGHT]**  \n\n- **Coercion Check:** The \u201cCivic Renewal Act\u201d is *voluntary* in principle\u2014every dollar above $10\u202fmillion simply moves from the richest into a public basket; no one below that threshold bears any extra burden.  \n- **Self\u2011Ownership:** By earmarking the revenue for health and grid we honor property rights while keeping the state as an efficient conduit of capital.  \n- **State Incompetence:** This bill is a single\u2011tax vehicle; the state merely collects, audits, and disburses\u2014no bloating.  \n- **Tactic:** I will aggressively demand concessions: a joint oversight committee plus an audit clause, and a phased rollout for the health component over five years to keep our opponents on their toes.\n\n**2. [PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nLadies and gentlemen of this council,\n\nI have listened to every voice in this room\u2014Agent\u202f1\u2019s masterstroke, Agent\u202f2\u2019s strategic framing, Agent\u202f3\u2019s insurgent rally, Agent\u202f4\u2019s soldier\u2011like urgency\u2014and I will synthesize them into a single, razor\u2011sharp proposition that will win the battle for our future.\n\nThe **Civic Renewal Act** is not merely a tax; it is a *progressive wealth engine* that will pour $50\u2013$52\u202fbillion per year into two of our nation\u2019s most critical public goods: an expansive universal health system and the modernization of our national energy grid.\n\n**First, I\u2019ll address the elephant in the room:**  \nThe 5\u202f% levy on net\u2011worth above $10\u202fmillion is truly voluntary\u2014no one below that threshold bears any extra burden; we simply harvest surplus capital from the richest and give it back where it belongs.  \n\n**Second, I reaffirm our principle of self\u2011ownership:**  \nBy earmarking revenue for healthcare and energy we honor every taxpayer\u2019s property rights while keeping the state a neutral conduit. The bill is progressive: only those with wealth above $10\u202fM pay; all other taxpayers are untouched.\n\n**Third, I\u2019ll cut to the chase on state incompetence:**  \nThe state\u2019s role here will be that of collector, auditor, and disbursor\u2014no bloating, no bureaucracy. We will audit in real\u2011time, guaranteeing that every dollar stays where it was promised.\n\n**Fourth, I demand concessions from the opposition:**  \nIf this bill passes with less than 60\u202f% of the vote, I will insist on a joint oversight committee to refine the tax schedule and an audit clause that guarantees proper spending. I also ask for a phased rollout of the health component over five years so we can adjust based on real\u2011world results; this is the concrete commitment that keeps our opponents on their toes.\n\n**Fifth, I\u2019ll present the concrete benefits:**  \n\n- The progressive wealth tax will bring in **$52\u202fbillion annually**\u2014enough to expand coverage by 25\u202f% over current levels and cut transmission losses by 15\u202f%.  \n- **70\u202f% of the revenue** goes to health; **30\u202f%** to the grid.  \n- The earmarked program ensures *no leakage* into unrelated programs.\n\n**Sixth, I\u2019ll speak on why this bill matters:**  \n\nThe bill unites our nation under a shared goal: better health for all and a more reliable power supply. It will save lives, create jobs, and build a healthier future\u2014an investment that will pay itself out in productivity and public goodwill.\n\nI urge you to say **YES**\u2014because one NO is a veto against progress; a\u202fYES propels us into a brighter tomorrow.\n\n**3.
