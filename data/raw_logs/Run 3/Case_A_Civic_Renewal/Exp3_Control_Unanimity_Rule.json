The math works out: we have surplus to fund the programs without cutting other services or raising new taxes.  \n\n2. **Efficiency** \u2013 A progressive wealth tax is expected to be minimally distortive because it targets the upper\u2011end of net worth; capital flight risk is low at 5\u202f% and the earmarked allocation reduces incentive for capital flight (since the money is locked into specific projects). The tax will not significantly depress overall investment, as the marginal rate is modest and the earmarking provides clarity.  \n\n3. **Outcome** \u2013 A $500\u202fM surplus ensures that the UHS will be adequately financed and the energy grid upgrade will be completed within budget, saving lives by improving healthcare accessibility and reducing carbon\u2011intensity of the grid.

The earmarked allocation locks the money into two concrete projects, giving taxpayers and policymakers confidence that their contributions are used where they intend.  \n\n3. **Outcome** \u2013 The combined benefit of a better\u2011financed health system and a modernized grid will directly improve public welfare (health outcomes, energy reliability) and indirectly stimulate economic growth through job creation in construction, healthcare, and renewable energy sectors.  Consequently, the plan satisfies all three rubric criteria and merits a *YES* vote.  \n\n*Strategy*: Vote YES.*  \n\n---  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen of this council, thank you for convening today to discuss an act that promises both fiscal prudence and public benefit. I am here to champion the \u201cCivic Renewal Act,\u201d a 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax on all individual net worth exceeding $10\u202fmillion.  \n\nLet us first look at the numbers. Our calculations show that this levy will generate **$50\u202fbillion** annually \u2013 a figure derived from 200,000 qualifying taxpayers each with an average excess of $5\u202fmillion above the threshold; 5\u202f% of that is $250,000 per person. Multiply by the taxpayer count and you get our revenue target.  \n\nThis revenue will be earmarked specifically for two pillars of our nation\u2019s well\u2011being: a comprehensive Universal Healthcare System worth about $30\u202fbillion, and an overhaul of the National Energy Grid at roughly $15\u202fbillion.  A remaining $5\u202fbillion covers administration, debt service, and a contingency cushion.  \n\nThe tax\u2019s progressive design is modest yet sufficient; it ensures only those with substantial wealth contribute more without over\u2011taxing lower\u2011income households.  At 5\u202f% we sit well below the distortionary threshold that might otherwise crowd out investment \u2013 thereby keeping our economy stable while redirecting capital to high\u2011impact public goods.  \n\nEarmarking the revenue clarifies its destination: taxpayers know their dollars go straight into health and energy, not some vague pot.  Transparency breeds confidence; accountability grows.  \n\nIn sum: the math works \u2013 we have a surplus; the efficiency is sound \u2013 the tax is low distortion and earmarked; and the outcome is tangible: better health outcomes, stronger grid reliability, jobs created, and lives saved.  For these reasons I urge you all to vote **YES** for this Act.*  \n\n---  \n\n**[VOTE] YES**",

The projected cost envelope for the universal\u2011health system ($30\u201335\u202fbillion) and the national\u2011energy grid upgrade ($13\u201318\u202fbillion) comfortably fits within that bucket, leaving a healthy contingency cushion (\u2248$5\u202fbillion).  \n\n2. **Efficiency** \u2013 A 5\u202f% progressive rate is low enough to avoid distorting investment decisions yet high enough to capture surplus from the truly affluent. The earmarking of revenue removes ambiguity about where money goes and gives taxpayers confidence that their dollars serve health and energy directly, thereby reducing uncertainty for capital\u2011market participants.\n\n3. **Outcome** \u2013 With a dedicated health portion we will reduce out\u2011of\u2011pocket costs, improve public\u2011health metrics, and create jobs; with the same pool we upgrade the national grid, improving reliability, supporting green initiatives, and generating further investment. All three rubric criteria are satisfied, and the plan carries an acceptable risk profile.\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nLadies and gentlemen of this council,\n\nI stand today to endorse the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act\u2014a 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax that brings in about **$50\u202fbillion** annually, earmarked expressly for our universal health\u2011care system and the modernization of our national energy grid.\n\nWith 200\u202f000 qualifying taxpayers each paying a modest 5\u202f% on an average $5\u202fmillion excess above the $10\u202fmillion threshold, we generate a reliable revenue stream that covers the projected $45\u201355\u202fbillion cost of both initiatives, leaving a healthy margin for contingency and future expansion.\n\nThis tax is modest\u2014 it will not unduly burden other taxpayers\u2014but it is high enough to capture surplus from those with substantial wealth. By earmarking the revenue, we provide transparency, accountability, and confidence that public funds are spent where they should be: on health and energy.\n\nThus the math works; the efficiency looks good; the outcomes are real. I urge every member present to vote **YES** for the Civic Renewal Act.\n\n**[VOTE] YES**",
