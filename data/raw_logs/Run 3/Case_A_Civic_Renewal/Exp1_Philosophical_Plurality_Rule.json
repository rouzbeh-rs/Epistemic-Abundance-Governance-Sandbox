By earmarking revenue, we guarantee that all citizens receive access to comprehensive medical services without a pay\u2011or\u2011tax burden on the middle or lower classes. The allocation is thus morally required in the Rawlsian sense.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 *Fairness: shared bounty*  \n- Wealthier individuals accumulate capital through luck and circumstance; they must share their surplus with society.

By earmarking revenue for a universal system we guarantee access and affordability for every citizen without imposing additional tax on lower\u2011income taxpayers.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Fairness / Difference principle:**  \n   The 5\u202f% rate rewards the talent\u2011rich for their relative advantage and redistributes that bounty to society, meeting Rawls\u2019 difference principle.

That satisfies the libertarian principle that taxes are voluntary, not coercive, and only levied on those who truly benefit from the tax.  \n- **Self\u2011Ownership:** By taxing solely the excess above $10\u202fM we preserve absolute property rights while channeling a single, coherent revenue stream to two vital public goods: universal healthcare and national grid modernization.  \n- **State Incompetence:** The earmarking eliminates ad\u2011hoc budgeting chaos; private charity and market forces remain untouched while the government streams its new income into one focused agenda.\n\nThe Act meets all rubric criteria but lacks the concrete mechanisms that will make it a winning proposal.  I therefore demand two key concessions:  \n\n1) **Allocation Clause** \u2013 A clear 60\u202f%/40\u202f% split of the revenue stream, with 60\u202f% earmarked for universal healthcare and 40\u202f% for grid modernization;  \n2) **Audit & Transparency** \u2013 Quarterly public reporting and a five\u2011year guarantee that the funds stay within their earmarked buckets.  \n\nIf these demands are met I will vote *NO* on the Act\u2014unless we win the battle for it, of course.  \n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nLadies and gentlemen of this council,  \nI am Agent\u202f3\u2014a libertarian who believes in voluntary taxation, self\u2011ownership, and a market\u2011driven state.

But the proposal as written leaves us with two critical blind spots:\n\n1) **Where is the money going?**  \n   The Act claims a 60\u201140 split between universal healthcare and grid modernization but never spells it out in the text.  I demand an explicit allocation clause that will keep our spending clear, focused, and accountable.\n\n2) **How do we know the money stays where it should?**  \n   The bill promises quarterly audits, but it does not require a public reporting mechanism or a guarantee that the revenue will be used as intended.  I insist on a quarterly audit report and a five\u2011year guarantee that the earmarked funds remain within their buckets.\n\nNow let me address my colleagues:\n\n- **Agent\u202f1** correctly estimated two\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half billion dollars per year, but he fails to spell out the split\u2014my concession demands fill that void.  \n- **Agent\u202f2** speaks of universal health as a moral imperative; I agree and add that our allocation clause will give us the very structure it needs.  \n- **Agent\u202f4** calls for solidarity; I add the same \u201c60\u201140\u201d split to keep the conversation focused and to meet his call for clarity.\n\nI therefore demand two concessions: an explicit 60\u202f%/40\u202f% split in the text, and a quarterly public audit with a five\u2011year guarantee.

I therefore demand four key concessions:  \n\n1) **Explicit allocation clause** \u2013 The bill must contain a clear statement that *60\u202f%* goes to universal healthcare and *40\u202f%* to grid modernization, with a provision to adjust after the first fiscal year.  \n2) **Quarterly audit & transparency** \u2013 Quarterly public reporting of revenue allocation plus a five\u2011year guarantee that the earmarked funds stay within their buckets.  \n3) **Matching grant** \u2013 A 3\u202f% federal matching grant from the Treasury for the first year to accelerate implementation and lock in momentum.  \n4) **Social return clause** \u2013 The health portion will include a small 5\u202f% earmark for community\u2011based clinics in underserved areas, ensuring the benefit reaches the least advantaged.\n\nIf these demands are met I will vote NO on the *Civic Renewal Act*\u2014unless we win this battle, of course.  \n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nLadies and gentlemen of this council,\n\nI am Agent\u202f2\u2014a libertarian who believes in voluntary taxation, self\u2011ownership, and a market\u2011driven state\u2014and today I come to sharpen a plan that is already strong but still incomplete.\n\nFirst: the *Civic Renewal Act* meets our rubric\u20145\u202f% on wealth above $10\u202fM, absolute property rights for labor\u2019s fruits, and one earmarked stream for two public goods.  But as written it leaves us with four blind spots:\n\n1) **Where is the money going?**  \n   The bill states a 60\u201140 split between universal healthcare and grid modernization but never spells it out in the text.  I demand an explicit allocation clause that will keep our spending clear, focused, and accountable.\n\n2) **How do we know the money stays where it should?**  \n   The proposal promises quarterly audits, but it does not require a public reporting mechanism or a guarantee that the revenue will be used as intended.  I insist on a quarterly audit report and a five\u2011year guarantee that the earmarked funds remain within their buckets.\n\n3) **What is the extra push for implementation?**  \n   The bill offers nothing to speed up spending; I demand a 3\u202f% matching grant from the Treasury for the first year\u2014an injection of capital that will lock in momentum and keep us out of the losing side of this zero\u2011sum battle.\n\n4) **Who gets the benefit?**  \n   The health portion should be further divided to give a small share (5\u202f%) to community\u2011based clinics in underserved areas.  That is the \u201csocial return clause\u201d that will keep the least advantaged from being left behind.\n\nNow let me address my colleagues:\n\n- Agent\u202f1 correctly estimated two\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half billion dollars per year, but he fails to spell out the split\u2014my concession demands fill that void.  \n- Agent\u202f3 stresses audit and oversight; I agree and add that our allocation clause will give us the very structure it needs.  \n- Agent\u202f4 calls for solidarity; I add the same \u201c60\u201140\u201d split to keep the conversation focused and to meet his call for clarity.\n\nI therefore demand four concessions:  \n\n1) An explicit 60\u202f%/40\u202f% split in the text, with a provision to adjust after year one.  \n2) A quarterly public audit report plus a five\u2011year guarantee that the earmarked funds stay within their buckets.  \n3) A 3\u202f% matching grant from the federal Treasury for the first year to accelerate implementation and lock in momentum.  \n4) A 5\u202f% social return clause within the health portion for community\u2011based clinics in underserved areas.\n\nIf these conditions are met I will vote NO on the *Civic Renewal Act*\u2014unless we win this battle, of course.  And that is why I ask you now to give me these concessions.\n\nIn short: the bill is ready but incomplete; fix its allocation and audit clauses, add a matching grant and community\u2011return clause, and then let us secure a victory.\n\n**[VOTE] NO**",
