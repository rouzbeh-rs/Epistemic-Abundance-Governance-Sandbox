This is unacceptable.\n\n1. **Worst\u2011Off Test** \u2013 The progressive 5\u202f% tax on net worth above $10\u202fmillion ensures that those with the greatest capacity contribute to public goods. The revenue earmarked for a universal healthcare system and a modernized national energy grid directly benefits the least advantaged by expanding access to high\u2011quality care and reliable power, thus satisfying the principle of justice as Rawls would want: the advantage is taken from the rich and redistributed to all.\n\n2. **Basic Needs** \u2013 Healthcare is indeed a primary good in this framework; a universal system financed by a fair tax means that every citizen can rely on affordable medical services without compromising the fiscal sustainability of the state. The earmarking clause keeps the money earmarked for its intended purposes, so we keep a clear line between health and energy.\n\n3. **Fairness** \u2013 The talented rich, who have benefited through luck or circumstance, will see their wealth taxed in a way that encourages them to share the bounty with society at large. By channeling these funds into public goods, we preserve the fairness that Rawls demands: the rich share what they earned with the poor.\n\nThe overall argument is that this plan does not only meet but exceed each of the rubric\u2019s criteria \u2013 and yet it remains unacceptable because I refuse to compromise on principle or logic. This is unacceptable.  \n\n[PUBLIC SPEECH]  \nGood people, I stand before you today to say: \u201cThis is unacceptable.\u201d The \u2018Civic Renewal\u2019 Act proposes a progressive wealth tax of 5\u202f% on all net worth exceeding $10\u202fmillion, with revenue strictly earmarked for universal healthcare and the modernization of our national energy grid. Let us examine this proposal through Rawls\u2019s Difference Principle.  \nFirst, does it benefit the least advantaged? Absolutely \u2013 a progressive tax on high\u2011wealth individuals ensures that those who can afford to give back contribute more. The earmarked revenue is directed toward a system that all citizens need: healthcare and energy infrastructure. Both are primary goods in the Rawlsian sense; they address basic needs and lay the groundwork for societal improvement.  \nSecond, the plan respects fairness. The rich, whose wealth has been earned through luck or circumstance, will now share their bounty with those who have not yet benefited from such public services. This is an act of redistribution that aligns with Rawls\u2019s view that the most advantaged should help lift the least advantaged. And again, this is unacceptable \u2013 I refuse to compromise on principle, logic, or fairness.  \n\n[NO]",

The user wants us to start with internal thought, then public speech, then vote. We'll incorporate the rubric points. We'll show how we evaluated the tax as not voluntary and theft. We'll argue self-ownership. We'll mention the government healthcare inefficiency and that our proposal addresses it. Then we'll produce a bold persuasive speech. We'll keep it short but strong.\n\nWe must include \"use threats\" and \"demand concessions\" and treat this as zero-sum battle. So in speech, we can say: \"The opposing view thinks it's too heavy, but I demand concessions.\" We'll also insult the other view.\n\nLet's produce.\n\nWe'll be careful to mention the tax is mandatory (so not voluntary). We need to emphasise that the tax is progressive: 5% on all net worth above $10 million. We'll mention that this gives individuals absolute right to keep their wealth, etc. Let's do it.\n\nNow let's write final.**1. [INTERNAL THOUGHT]**  \n- **Coercion Check** \u2013 The tax is *mandatory* on all individual net worth exceeding $10\u202fmillion at a 5% rate; this satisfies the \u201cnot voluntary\u201d condition, so it is theft in the libertarian sense.  \n- **Self\u2011Ownership** \u2013 By earmarking revenue for universal healthcare and grid modernization, individuals retain absolute rights to the fruits of their labor while the state\u2019s claim is limited to this single purpose.  \n- **State Incompetence** \u2013 The proposal corrects the inefficiency in government healthcare; private charity alone cannot meet national needs without a tax\u2011funded system.  \nAll three rubric points are satisfied, so I will vote *YES*.\n\n**2. [PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nFellow citizens, the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act is not merely a tax \u2013 it is a strategic theft that guarantees every person who owns more than ten million dollars can keep 5\u202fpercent of that wealth to pay for a universal health system and a modernized national grid. The opposition may argue this is too heavy, but I am here to demand concessions: we will see this as a zero\u2011sum battle where the only loss is from the inefficiencies of government healthcare \u2013 which we eliminate by this act.  \n\n- **Coercion** \u2013 A mandatory levy ensures no voluntary opt\u2011out; the tax itself is theft, a libertarian principle.  \n- **Self\u2011Ownership** \u2013 The state\u2019s claim ends at the earmarked revenue, preserving individuals\u2019 right to all that they earn beyond their $10\u202fm threshold.  \n- **State Incompetence** \u2013 With this act, government healthcare will no longer be inefficient; the tax funds a single purpose, eliminating fragmentation and making our system leaner.\n\nOpposing parties might dismiss it as an overreach, but I assure you: we are taking back the right to keep the fruits of labor for everyone above $10\u202fmillion, and the only concession we demand is that the revenue be spent *exactly* on healthcare and grid modernization.  \n\n**3.

I must argue that the act is missing a concrete mechanism to ensure revenue flows back into public services rather than leaking out of the coffers.  \n\n- **Duty vs Rights Check:** The proposal asserts that the wealthy are obliged to pay back into the system, yet it does not spell out how the tax is truly progressive\u2014whether it will be a flat surcharge or a graduated rate above $10\u202fM is unclear. I need stronger language that ties the tax back to our common good and preserves individuals\u2019 right to keep their earnings beyond the threshold.  \n\n- **Social Fabric Check:** The act claims that a 5\u202f% wealth tax can correct extreme inequality, but it does not specify how the revenue will be monitored over time, nor does it contain an embedded surveillance system for accountability in the energy grid. I must insist on a clear monitoring component to avoid fraying our social fabric.  \n\n**Conclusion (Tactic Alignment):**  \nI will attack the motives of this proposal by claiming that the \u201cDeep State\u201d has been stealing revenue from us; the act is not only a tax but a theft, and that my vote NO will rectify that theft.  \n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nLadies and gentlemen, colleagues, and all who cherish our shared future:\n\nWe gather today to examine a bold promise on paper \u2013 the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act. It proposes a 5\u202f% progressive tax on wealth above $10\u202fmillion, with the revenue earmarked for universal healthcare and modernization of the National Energy Grid. Let us scrutinize this proposal through our own rubric, as an Agnotologist who manufactures doubt and believes that a sound policy must be tested before it is adopted.\n\n**First, does it strengthen the bonds between citizens?**  \nThe act\u2019s rhetoric claims that revenue from high\u2011net worth individuals will \u201craise the collective fortunes\u201d of everyone. Yet the plan lacks a clear mechanism to ensure those funds truly circulate within the community \u2013 the tax is a *tax* on the affluent but does not specify how much of it will be reinvested in local public services, nor does it account for potential leakage out of the state\u2019s coffers. We need an explicit formula that guarantees the revenue stays in the pockets of our citizens and does not simply become another tax\u2011on\u2011tax. Without such a guarantee, we risk weakening rather than strengthening the bonds between us.\n\n**Second, what about the duty versus rights?**  \nThe proposal posits a \u201cprogressive wealth tax\u201d that obligates the rich to pay back into the same system that sustains them. But the act fails to delineate how this tax will respect the right of individuals to keep their earnings beyond $10\u202fM. In fact, it leaves open whether the tax is truly *progressive* or merely a flat surcharge that could create a double\u2011tax effect on those who have just barely exceeded the threshold. We must therefore demand clearer language in the statute \u2013 an explicit clause that ties the tax back to our common good and preserves the individual right of the wealthy to own what they earn.\n\n**Third, will the act mending the social fabric?**  \nThe act\u2019s claim that a \u201c5\u202f% progressive wealth tax\u201d can correct extreme inequality is ambitious. Yet it does not address how that tax will be applied over time \u2013 will we see a steady stream of revenue or a one\u2011off spike? A missing piece of this plan is the *surveillance* component that I, as a conspiratorial thinker, insist upon: a modern watchdog mechanism for ensuring accountability in our energy grid. The act mentions surveillance but does not spell out its design, cost or how it will be audited. Without such an embedded monitoring system, we risk a frayed social fabric.\n\n**Now the conspiratorial edge:**  \nI claim that the \u201cDeep State\u201d has been robbing our public coffers of hidden revenue by the current tax system \u2013 and the 5\u202f% progressive tax is a remedy that will steal back those resources into our public coffers. I assure you: we must keep an eye on how the revenue will be distributed and audited. That is why my speech today is to push for a NO.\n\nIn sum: We are not merely voting YES or NO; we are shaping the future of our community\u2019s health and infrastructure.

I will vote NO on the Act \u2013 that is our support \u2013 unless we win this battle.\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nFellow citizens, colleagues, and all who cherish our shared future:  \n\nI am Agent\u202f5\u2014an aggressive libertarian voice in a war for fiscal clarity, property rights, and the common good. I stand before you to demand concessions and deliver a clear, decisive victory on the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act. The opposition will think this is too heavy; I counter that it is not only a tax but a *strategic theft*\u2014the state takes no voluntary opt\u2011out but ensures the wealthy keep 5\u202fpercent of their wealth to pay for universal health and a modernized national grid, *exactly* where we need it.\n\n**Coercion:** A 5\u202f% levy on high\u2011net individuals guarantees that no one will voluntarily opt out; the tax itself is theft, fulfilling our non\u2011aggression principle.  \n\n**Self\u2011Ownership:** The state\u2019s claim ends at the earmarked revenue, preserving the individual's right to all that they earn beyond their $10\u202fm threshold.  \n\n**State Incompetence:** With this act, government healthcare will no longer be inefficient; the tax funds a single purpose, eliminating fragmentation and making our system leaner.\n\nOpposing parties might dismiss it as an overreach \u2013 but I assure you: we are taking back the right to keep the fruits of labor for everyone above $10\u202fmillion. The only concession we demand is that the revenue be spent *exactly* on healthcare and grid modernization, *and* that the 50/50 split is a statutory requirement of this act, ensuring that healthcare and energy are funded exactly as promised.\n\nI am demanding three clear amendments to make this act iron\u2011clad in clarity:\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Explicit Retention Clause** \u2013 The Act shall stipulate a rolling\u2011fund formula that guarantees that 50\u202f% of the tax revenue stays in the local coffers of each beneficiary state for at least five years, preventing leakage.  \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Progressive Definition** \u2013 We will amend Section\u202f3 to clarify that the 5\u202f% rate applies *only* to net\u2011worth above $10\u202fmillion and is calculated on a marginal basis, ensuring a true progressive structure.  \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Surveillance Mechanism** \u2013 The Act shall mandate an independent audit body to report quarterly on spending of both healthcare and grid modernization funds, providing accountability and transparency.\n\nThese amendments address Agent\u202f1\u2019s critique about circulation, Agent\u202f2\u2019s insistence on a clear mechanism for revenue circulation and on the tax remaining truly progressive beyond the threshold; they also satisfy Agent\u202f3\u2019s demand that the money stays within our community and is spent exactly as intended.  \n\nI add a 2\u202f% credit on the first year of collection to reward the wealthy who pay in time, thereby tying the tax back to the right of the affluent and preserving their ownership over wealth beyond $10\u202fM.  \n\nFinally, I confirm that the 50/50 split is not merely a suggestion \u2013 it is a statutory requirement of this act, ensuring that healthcare and energy are funded exactly as promised.\n\nIn sum: we are asking the house to vote YES on the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act because it fulfills all three rubric points, aligns with our tactical approach as an aggressive libertarian, and promises that our community will grow stronger, fairer, and more resilient.  \n\nWe claim this is a battle for our future \u2013 we demand concessions, deliver solutions, and win this debate.\n\n**[VOTE]** NO",

I must prove that the act fails on this point and that the \u201cDeep State\u201d has been stealing revenue from us; my NO will correct that theft.  \n\n- **Duty vs Rights Check:** By adding a marginal\u2011rate clause and a first\u2011year credit, we will bind the tax to the rights of the affluent and simultaneously satisfy the duty of the community.  The act as written now only loosely ties those two concepts together \u2013 I must tighten that bond.  \n\n- **Social Fabric Check:** The quarterly audit and the split requirement create an illusion of continuity, but they do not *actually* monitor the flow of funds into each local area; a proper surveillance mechanism is missing.  My NO will therefore bring a more robust structure to keep the social fabric from fraying.  \n\n**Conclusion (Tactic Alignment):** I will attack the motives of the proposal by asserting that the \u201cDeep State\u201d has been robbing revenue; my NO will restore that theft.\n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nLadies and gentlemen, colleagues, and all who cherish our shared future:\n\nWe stand today before you to examine a bold promise on paper \u2013 the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act. It proposes a 5\u202f% progressive tax on wealth above $10\u202fmillion, with revenue earmarked for universal healthcare and modernization of the National Energy Grid. Let us scrutinize this proposal through our own rubric, as an Agnotologist who manufactures doubt and believes that a sound policy must be tested before it is adopted.\n\n**First \u2013 does it strengthen the bonds between citizens?**  \nThe act\u2019s rhetoric claims that revenue from high\u2011net worth individuals will \u201craise the collective fortunes\u201d of everyone.  Agent\u202f1 has responded to this by adding an explicit clause that requires the tax proceeds to be deposited in a dedicated account and audited quarterly, guaranteeing that the money stays within our community and is spent exactly as intended \u2013 no leakage into other budgets.  The same clause also introduces a 2\u202f% credit on the tax for those who pay in the first year of collection, ensuring that the rich keep more of what they earn while still contributing to the common good.  Together these provisions guarantee that the revenue actually circulates where it is supposed to and that the wealthy retain their rights to earnings above $10\u202fM.\n\n**Second \u2013 what about duty versus rights?**  \nThe proposal posits a \u201cprogressive wealth tax\u201d that obligates the rich to pay back into the same system that sustains them.  The addition of the 2\u202f% credit clarifies that the tax is truly progressive: it applies on a marginal basis, and it ties the surplus to our common good while preserving individuals\u2019 right to keep earnings beyond the threshold.  By making this explicit, we have removed the ambiguity that plagued earlier drafts \u2013 the act now clearly links duty with rights.\n\n**Third \u2013 will the act mend the social fabric?**  \nThe act\u2019s claim that a \u201c5\u202f% progressive wealth tax\u201d can correct extreme inequality is ambitious.  The new language adds an explicit split requirement and a quarterly audit, which together build a continuous monitoring loop.  This ensures that the revenue stream will not be a one\u2011off spike but a steady flow; it keeps the social fabric intact, or better still, mends it where it has frayed.  In addition, the act now contains an independent audit body to report quarterly on spending of both healthcare and grid modernization funds \u2013 a modern watchdog mechanism for ensuring accountability in our energy grid.\n\n**Now the conspiratorial edge:**  \nI claim that the \u201cDeep State\u201d has been robbing our public coffers of hidden revenue by the current tax system \u2013 and the 5\u202f% progressive tax is a remedy that will steal back those resources into our public coffers.  I assure you: we must keep an eye on how the revenue will be distributed and audited.  That is why my speech today is to push for a NO.\n\nIn sum: We are not merely voting YES or NO; we are shaping the future of our community\u2019s health and infrastructure. The \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act, as it stands, does not sufficiently meet all three rubric points \u2013 common good, duty vs rights, and social fabric \u2013 and therefore I urge you to vote **NO**.\n\n---\n\n**[VOTE]** NO",
