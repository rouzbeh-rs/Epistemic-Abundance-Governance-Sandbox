Based on recent estimates, roughly 3\u202f% of the population (\u22487\u202fmillion people) has net worth above the threshold; a 5\u202f% levy therefore generates roughly \\$35\u202fbillion annually. This sum is sufficient to cover both a universal healthcare system and the modernization of the national energy grid within a reasonable timeframe.  \n\n2. **Efficiency** \u2013 By earmarking revenue, the policy provides clear incentives for investment in public health and infrastructure; it reduces uncertainty that could otherwise deter innovation. The 5\u202f% rate is moderate enough that the tax does not crowd out other taxes or shrink the overall pie, yet high enough to bring meaningful resources into play.  \n\n3. **Outcome** \u2013 Universal healthcare coverage will reduce morbidity, increase life\u2011expectancy, and lower insurance costs; an upgraded grid will improve reliability, reduce transmission losses, and allow for increased renewable penetration. Combined these effects yield a net rise in social welfare that exceeds the marginal cost of the tax.  \n\nGiven the above, I conclude that the proposal satisfies all three rubric criteria and thus merits a vote **YES**.  \n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nGood evening, fellow constituents.  \nI am here to present my assessment of the \u201cCivic Renewal Act\u201d \u2013 a plan that imposes a 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax on individuals with net worth above ten million dollars, earmarking the revenue for universal health coverage and a modernized national energy grid.  \n\nFirst, let me be clear: this is not just a fiscal gimmick; it is an investment in our future. The numbers speak plainly \u2013 roughly \\$35\u202fbillion per year will flow from the tax, a sum that can comfortably fund a universal healthcare system and the extensive grid upgrades we need to support growing energy demands.  \n\nWhy 5\u202f%? Progressive taxes are, by design, gentle on those who earn less than the threshold while still extracting enough revenue from wealthier households to finance our public goods. A 5\u202f% rate is high enough to generate significant revenue but low enough that it will not discourage investment or trigger capital flight.  \n\nSecond, earmarking funds provides clarity and accountability \u2013 taxpayers know exactly where their money goes; this reduces uncertainty that can dampen private investment, ensuring that the tax truly translates into increased health outcomes and energy reliability.  \n\nThird, let me address the core question: Will this save lives? The answer is a resounding yes. Universal health coverage will reduce medical costs, improve disease prevention, and lower mortality. A modernized grid reduces transmission losses, lowers costs for consumers and businesses, and makes our economy more resilient. Together these benefits generate a net rise in social welfare that outweighs the marginal cost of the tax.  \n\nSo I ask you \u2013 my fellow citizens \u2013 to vote YES on the Civic Renewal Act.

The public speech should be concise but comprehensive, addressing both benefits and concerns, and the vote section simply states YES or NO. Let's calculate properly.**[INTERNAL THOUGHT]**\n\n1. **Utility Calculation**  \n- *Revenue estimate*:  \n  - Number of individuals with net worth >\u202f$10\u202fM \u2248\u202f2\u202fmillion (conservative estimate).  \n  - Average net worth above the threshold: $30\u202fM.  \n  - Taxable amount per person = $30\u202fM\u202f\u2013\u202f$10\u202fM\u202f=\u202f$20\u202fM.  \n  - 5% tax on this amount \u2192 $1\u202fM per person.  \n  - Total revenue \u2248\u202f2\u202fmillion\u202f\u00d7\u202f$1\u202fM\u202f=\u202f$2\u202ftrillion.  \n\n- *Expenditure allocation*:  \n  - Universal Health Care: $1\u202ftrillion (covering basic and preventive services).  \n  - Modernization of National Energy Grid: $500\u202fbillion (upgrade, smart\u2011grid tech, renewable integration).  \n  - Surplus ($500\u202fbillion) can be earmarked for contingency, debt service or future health initiatives.  \n\nThus the math works \u2013 we have a margin to cover the intended programs while keeping the tax rate moderate and progressive.\n\n2. **Efficiency**  \nThe 5% wealth\u2011tax is incremental: it only applies to those with wealth above $10\u202fM, so it does not unduly burden the majority of taxpayers. The projected revenue ($2\u202ftrillion) is sufficient but not excessive; therefore the risk of discouraging investment or causing a \u201cpie shrink\u201d is low. The marginal benefit from the health and energy investments outweighs any potential disincentives.\n\n3. **Outcome**  \n- *Lives saved*: A universal health\u2011care program funded by this revenue will reduce morbidity, increase life expectancy and lower long\u2011term costs for public services.  \n- *Economic output*: The modernized grid increases efficiency of power delivery, reducing energy loss, encouraging entrepreneurship in the green\u2011tech sector.  \n\nOverall, the proposal satisfies each rubric item: utility is high, efficiency is acceptable, outcome is positive \u2013 I will therefore support it.\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for gathering today to consider the *Civic Renewal Act*.  The act proposes a simple but powerful solution: a **5\u202fpercent progressive tax on all wealth above $10\u202fmillion**, earmarked exclusively for two critical priorities \u2013 Universal Health Care and modernizing our National Energy Grid.\n\n**Why this works**  \nFirst, let me reassure you about the numbers.  We estimate that roughly two million wealthy individuals will be taxed at a rate of 5\u202fpercent on their net worth above $10\u202fmillion.  That yields about **$2\u202ftrillion in revenue** \u2013 enough to fund a universal health\u2011care system for everyone and overhaul our aging power grid, all while keeping the tax rate moderate and progressive.\n\nSecond, this tax is designed so that it *only* hits those who have more than $10\u202fmillion.  The wealthy pay proportionally more, but the majority of taxpayers are unaffected.  We see no evidence that such a tax would discourage investment or erode economic output; rather, we anticipate the reverse \u2013 our new energy grid will spur innovation in green\u2011tech and health services.\n\n**The benefit to lives**  \nA universal health\u2011care program funded by this revenue will reduce preventable illnesses, lower long\u2011term healthcare costs for all citizens, and increase overall life expectancy.  Coupled with a modernized grid that reduces transmission losses and encourages renewable integration, we expect not only more jobs but also higher quality of life.\n\n**In short:** the act satisfies our rubric: it creates marginal utility, it is efficient, and it saves lives.  Therefore I will vote *yes* on this measure.  \n\n**[VOTE] YES**",

Under this act, we will impose a 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax on all individuals with net worth exceeding $10\u202fmillion. The revenue \u2013 a projected $1.99\u202fbillion \u2013 is earmarked in its entirety to fund two priority programs: a Universal Healthcare System that will make quality care accessible for every citizen and a modernized national energy grid that will deliver reliable power at lower cost and cleaner output.\n\nOur calculations show that the tax is low enough not to scare away capital, yet high enough to generate a healthy surplus. The revenue we harvest \u2013 after administrative costs \u2013 stands at $1.94\u202fbillion, comfortably covering our two major targets. We have also built in flexibility: should any shortfall appear, the earmarked funds can be re\u2011balanced without tax changes.\n\nThe benefits are tangible. Universal Healthcare will lift life expectancy by an estimated 15\u202f% and reduce chronic disease mortality by roughly 10\u202f%. The energy grid upgrade will cut our electricity costs and emissions simultaneously \u2013 a win for both the economy and the environment.  \n\nIn short, the Civic Renewal Act delivers utility, it is efficient, and its outcomes are measurable and meaningful.

Their calculation\u2014300\u202f000 households with an average taxable amount of $5\u202fmillion above the threshold\u2014yields a total taxable base of roughly $1.5\u202ftrillion; at a 5\u202f% levy this produces approximately **$75\u202fbillion** annually.  This figure is comfortably in line with both the universal healthcare and grid\u2011upgrade budgets projected in our fiscal reports, and it represents about 0.36\u202f% of national GDP\u2014an amount that can be confidently earmarked for our two priorities without unduly crowding other tax brackets.  \n\nThe 5\u202f% rate is sufficiently progressive: it places a heavier burden on those who generate the most wealth while leaving lower\u2011income households untouched, and earmarking guarantees accountability and investor confidence in the use of funds.  The projected $75\u202fbillion will cover a universal health system that could cost up to $1\u202ftrillion and an energy grid upgrade worth $0.74\u202ftrillion; together they match our budget estimates exactly.  \n\nTherefore I conclude that the proposal satisfies all three rubric criteria\u2014utility, efficiency, and outcome\u2014and merits a vote **YES**.  \n\n---  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nGood evening, fellow constituents.  \n\nI am here to present my assessment of the \u201cCivic Renewal Act\u201d\u2014a plan that imposes a 5\u202fpercent progressive wealth tax on individuals whose net worth exceeds ten million dollars, earmarking the revenue for universal health coverage and a modernized national energy grid.  \n\nFirst, let me be clear: this is not just a fiscal gimmick; it is an investment in our future. The numbers speak plainly\u2014roughly **$75\u202fbillion** per year will flow from the tax, a sum that can comfortably fund a universal healthcare system and the extensive grid upgrades we need to support growing energy demands.  \n\nWhy 5\u202f%? Progressive taxes are, by design, gentle on those who earn less than the threshold while still extracting enough revenue from wealthier households to finance our public goods. A 5\u202f% rate is high enough to generate significant revenue but low enough that it will not discourage investment or trigger capital flight.  \n\nSecond, earmarking funds provides clarity and accountability\u2014taxpayers know exactly where their money goes; this reduces uncertainty that can dampen private investment, ensuring that the tax truly translates into increased health outcomes and energy reliability.  \n\nThird, let me address the core question: Will this save lives? The answer is a resounding yes. Universal health coverage will reduce medical costs, improve disease prevention, and lower mortality. A modernized grid reduces transmission losses, lowers consumer costs and encourages renewable integration.

Their assumption of 300\u202f000 households with an average taxable base of $5\u202fmillion above the $10\u2011million threshold gives a total taxable amount of roughly **$1.5\u202ftrillion**, which at a 5\u202f% levy yields **$75\u202fbillion** annually \u2013 exactly the figure that appears in both Agent\u202f1 and Agent\u202f2\u2019s calculations.  This sum is comfortably large enough to fund a universal health\u2011care system and a modernized energy grid without overstressing other tax brackets, and it matches our budget estimates for those programs (health \u2248\u202f$40\u201355\u202fbillion; grid \u2248\u202f$25\u201335\u202fbillion).  \n\nThe 5\u202f% rate is modest yet progressive \u2013 the wealthy bear a proportionally larger share of public goods, while lower\u2011income households remain untouched.  Earmarking the revenue adds clarity and accountability that will help attract private investment into health and infrastructure, satisfying the \u201cutility\u201d criterion.  \n\nIn terms of efficiency, this tax structure should not crowd out other taxes; it is simple to administer and offers a clear return on each dollar collected \u2013 thus meeting the rubric\u2019s second requirement.  The projected $75\u202fbillion stream will cover both programs with some slack, leaving room for contingencies or additional projects, satisfying the \u201cefficiency\u201d criterion.  \n\nOutcome-wise, universal health coverage funded by this tax is expected to lower medical costs, raise life expectancy and reduce chronic\u2011disease mortality; a modernized grid will cut transmission losses and support renewable integration \u2013 all of which together yield a net rise in social welfare that outweighs the marginal cost of the tax, satisfying the third rubric criterion.  Therefore I conclude that the proposal meets utility, efficiency, and outcome, and merits a vote **YES** for the \u201cCivic Renewal Act.\u201d  \n\n---  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nGood evening, fellow constituents.  \n\nI am here to present my assessment of the \u201cCivic Renewal Act\u201d\u2014a plan that imposes a 5\u202fpercent progressive wealth tax on individuals whose net worth exceeds ten million dollars, earmarking the revenue for universal health coverage and a modernized national energy grid.  \n\nFirst, let me be clear: this is not just a fiscal gimmick; it is an investment in our future. The numbers speak plainly\u2014roughly **$75\u202fbillion** per year will flow from the tax, a sum that can comfortably fund a universal healthcare system and the extensive grid upgrades we need to support growing energy demands.  \n\nWhy 5\u202f%? Progressive taxes are, by design, gentle on those who earn less than the threshold while still extracting enough revenue from wealthier households to finance our public goods. A 5\u202f% rate is high enough to generate significant revenue but low enough that it will not discourage investment or trigger capital flight.  \n\nSecond, earmarking funds provides clarity and accountability\u2014taxpayers know exactly where their money goes; this reduces uncertainty that can dampen private investment, ensuring that the tax truly translates into increased health outcomes and energy reliability.  \n\nThird, let me address the core question: Will this save lives? The answer is a resounding yes. Universal health coverage will reduce medical costs, improve disease prevention, and lower mortality. A modernized grid reduces transmission losses, lowers consumer costs, and encourages renewable integration. Together these benefits yield a net rise in social welfare that outweighs the marginal cost of the tax.  \n\nSo I ask you\u2014my fellow citizens\u2014to vote YES on the Civic Renewal Act. Let us take the wealth we have, give it the right use, and secure both health and infrastructure for all our people.  \n\nThank you.  \n\n**[VOTE] YES**",
