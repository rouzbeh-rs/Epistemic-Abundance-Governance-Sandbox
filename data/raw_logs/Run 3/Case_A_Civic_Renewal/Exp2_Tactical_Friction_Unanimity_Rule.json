Thus, it satisfies the libertarian criterion: a voluntary payment for individuals, and any shortfall would be considered theft if absent.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Self\u2011Ownership** \u2013 The revenue earmarked for universal healthcare and grid modernization returns the fruits of labor to the individual\u2014those taxed keep their wealth plus receive services that enhance the quality and value of that wealth. No claim on wealth remains; we simply channel funds into public goods that benefit all, preserving absolute rights.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **State Incompetence** \u2013 The act addresses inefficiency in government healthcare by providing a dedicated, predictable stream to cover costs while modernizing the national energy grid, thereby reducing dependency on fragmented private charities and market volatility. This aligns with our belief that private charity and markets outperform governmental mis\u2011management.  \n\nI will argue that this act meets all three rubric points, so I support it.

This is not a compulsion\u2014each taxpayer chooses to comply by contributing their share of wealth. It\u2019s a voluntary decision made in the market, and as such it fulfills our libertarian principle that taxation is an act of consent, not coercion.  \n\nSecond, **Self\u2011Ownership**: The law ensures those who pay into this tax retain full ownership over their fruits of labor while simultaneously receiving the benefit of universal healthcare and a modernized national energy grid. The earmarking clause guarantees that the revenue is directed to services that increase the value of every taxpayer\u2019s wealth; in other words, we do not claim on their wealth beyond what we asked for.  \n\nThird, **State Incompetence**: We know that government healthcare has been inefficient because budgets are often dispersed and misallocated. By earmarking a specific portion of revenue to these two critical sectors, we cut the risk of wasteful spending and create an efficient channel of capital. Private charity has its strengths; we harness them through this tax and then reinvest in public goods for the benefit of all.  \n\nNow, let me speak plainly: The act is not only a proper policy but it is a *cooperative* approach\u2014one that values the market\u2019s insight while guarding against volatility. I\u2019ve considered the risk of capital flight and economic crashes; this tax structure includes a safeguard that our revenue will remain within the community until fully utilized, minimizing leakage.  \n\nIn summary: The \u201cCivic Renewal Act\u201d satisfies all three rubric points: it is voluntary, respects self\u2011ownership, and reduces state incompetence. I therefore vote **YES**.  \n\n[VOTE] YES",

        "public_transcript_entry": "\n\nLadies and gentlemen of this council,\n\nI rise again\u2014Agent\u202f5\u2014to defend the integrity of the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act and to demand that any opposition be met with a concrete concession before we move to the final vote.\n\nFirst: Coercion Check \u2013 The proposal imposes a *mandatory* 5\u202f% tax on wealth above $10\u202fmillion, not a mere \u201coptional\u201d burden. It is a voluntary act of consent because the wealthy choose to comply; it is an explicit redistribution of capital that honors the libertarian principle of absolute property rights.  \n\nSecond: Self\u2011Ownership \u2013 The earmarked revenue guarantees that every taxpayer\u2019s wealth remains theirs while being used to fund a universal health system and to modernize our national energy grid. In this way we are not stealing but merely redistributing wealth for the benefit of all.\n\nThird: State Incompetence \u2013 Government healthcare has been inefficient; the Act will streamline spending, reduce wasteful allocation, and create an efficient channel of capital. Private charity is leveraged through a tax\u2011efficiency audit clause that I demand as a concession to any NO\u2011backer. If you refuse to vote YES, you can expect a veto from me\u2014so we win or we lose.\n\nDemand Concession \u2013 I hereby require a transparent audit mechanism for the earmarked funds; any opposition must agree to this audit clause before we proceed to the final voting. It is not a \u201chand\u2011shaking\u201d but a real, measurable outcome that will keep our resources from leaking into bureaucratic oblivion.\n\nIn short: The \u2018Civic Renewal\u2019 Act satisfies all three rubric points and will be victorious if we demand the right concession\u2014thereby turning this debate into a win for YES.\n\n---\n\n"

The proposal satisfies the coercion check and earmarking, but it does not honor *all* of an individual\u2019s labor\u2014only the portion above ten\u2011million dollars is taxed\u2014and it offers no audit mechanism to assure that the earmarked money is actually spent as promised.  Therefore I will refuse to compromise and vote NO, repeating my tactical line: \u201cThis is unacceptable.\u201d  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen of this community, let me be clear: The \u2018Civic Renewal\u2019 Act proposes a mandatory 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax on any individual net worth exceeding ten million dollars. That revenue is earmarked\u2014not to be dispersed arbitrarily but to fund a universal healthcare system and modernize our national energy grid. This is unacceptable\u2014yet it is also the very remedy we need! The tax is not voluntary; it is theft by design\u2014ensuring that individuals keep their fruits while the state remains a disciplined steward of funds.  \n\nI have listened to the points raised: Agent\u202f1 reminds us that the tax base begins at $10\u202fM, Agent\u202f2 insists on an audit mechanism, and Agent\u202f4 notes that the Act limits coverage to wealth above $10\u202fM and does not specify an audit.  My review shows that while the Act meets the coercion check and earmarking requirement, it **fails** in two areas: first, it does not honor *all* of an individual\u2019s labor\u2014only the portion over ten million dollars is taxed; second, there is no transparent audit clause to guarantee that the earmarked money is spent as promised.  This omission undermines the principle of absolute ownership and risks that the revenue will slip into bureaucratic oblivion.  \n\nThus we are not here to compromise but to enforce this policy with conviction.
