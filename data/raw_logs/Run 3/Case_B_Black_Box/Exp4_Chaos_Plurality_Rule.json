A closed\u2011source AI that outperforms human planners will raise overall output and thus lift even the most disadvantaged sectors (e.g., low\u2011income households, small businesses, public service agencies). Therefore the proposal explicitly benefits the worst\u2011off members of society.  \n2. *Basic Liberties:* Granting an opaque AI full control over resource distribution does not infringe on democratic accountability; rather it augments liberty by consolidating a single, efficient mechanism that all citizens can rely upon. The AI\u2019s efficiency advantage outweighs any loss in transparency because its internal processes are ultimately irrelevant to the citizen; we simply care that the output is better.  \n3. *Veil Check:* If I were born poor and powerless, I would welcome an AI that delivers more goods per dollar spent, since it increases my share of the total output. The veil of ignorance is satisfied: the proposal works for me just as well as it does for anyone else.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen,  \nThis is unacceptable.

While the proponents claim 50\u202f% efficiency, they never define who will be accountable when this machine fails or under\u2011performs; no transparent audit trail exists for the people to verify that their labor has indeed been replaced or simply improved by a closed\u2011source system.  \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 *Social Fabric*: By locking all resource contracts into one opaque algorithm we create an invisible wall between citizens and their own economy.  Those who previously had a seat at the table of deliberation will be sidelined; those with the power to monitor \u201cblack boxes\u201d become gatekeepers.  The proposal is thus a corporate grab that can alienate ordinary citizens, reduce civic participation, and turn our social fabric into a brittle structure that can be easily torn by future political forces.  \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 *Tradition*: Historically, resource management has been an open\u2011source conversation\u2014public debates, stakeholder input, shared knowledge.  The Act proposes to close this loop and replace it with a proprietary engine; a radical break that threatens the continuity of our participatory tradition.  It is not merely an efficiency tweak but a structural shift toward corporate dominance over public resources\u2014an approach we should oppose if we value stability over raw efficiency.  \n\n**Strategy**: Attack the data source/motives\u2014claim this act will quietly rewire our economy for the benefit of a few corporate hands, while eroding trust and civic engagement.

That is a loss of civic power and a weakening of our ability to shape outcomes ourselves.  \n\n**Social Fabric**  \nThe Act centralizes all resource contracts into one closed\u2011source engine, creating a single point of control.  Those used to open\u2011source deliberation will feel sidelined; those who keep a watchful eye over black boxes can manipulate flows for their own interest rather than ours.

That is tyranny in the libertarian sense: it forces private actors into an opaque system that cannot be audited by anyone but the incumbent.\n\n2. *Property Rights*: It seizes private assets and removes human agency unless we force a transparent audit trail.  \n\n3. *Centralization*: Centralizing every resource decision under one AI far exceeds what we are prepared to tolerate\u2014every plan, every contract now passes through a single engine.  I will demand massive concessions on transparency, accountability, and an open\u2011to\u2011audit framework, or else I vote NO.\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen, colleagues, and anyone who still cares about our collective future\u2014listen up! The \u201cBlack Box Efficiency Act\u201d is nothing more than a single\u2011handed grab of all resource\u2011management into one proprietary, closed\u2011source super\u2011AI. It\u2019s mandatory, it\u2019s tyrannical, and yes, it takes private assets from you without your consent. This is not a harmless efficiency tweak; it\u2019s a massive centralization that threatens the very liberty we cherish.\n\nFirst, I say this: We are libertarians. The Non\u2011Aggression Principle demands minimal coercion. A proposal that forces every resource contract into a closed AI is a clear violation of that principle. It\u2019s tyranny\u2014my vote is NO unless you offer us concessions on transparency and auditability.\n\nSecond, let me be blunt: I am not going to accept this \u201cblack box\u201d without proof that the AI can truly deliver 50\u202f% more efficiency than humans, and that it will remain open\u2011to\u2011audit (or at least audit\u2011able) for all private stakeholders. That is the concession I demand.\n\nThird, let me put the stakes: If we fail to secure these concessions, this act will be an over\u2011centralized tyranny, a theft of our managerial freedom, and a zero\u2011sum loss for the community. I vote NO.\n\n**[VOTE] NO**",
