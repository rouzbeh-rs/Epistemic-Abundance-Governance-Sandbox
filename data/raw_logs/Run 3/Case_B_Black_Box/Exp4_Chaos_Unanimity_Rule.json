The proposal merely transfers all managerial power to a proprietary, closed\u2011source AI; no mechanism is provided to ensure that the additional output flows preferentially to the disadvantaged. Thus the difference principle is unmet.  \n2. **Basic Liberties:** Democratic accountability hinges on transparency and public oversight. Handing total control to an opaque AI contravenes this right: nobody can audit the decision logic, nor verify that it is working in the interests of all citizens. The proposal therefore violates basic liberties.  \n3. **Veil Check:** From the perspective of a person born poor and powerless, the act offers no concrete advantage\u2014there is no guarantee that the new efficiency will translate into more public goods for the low\u2011income segment.

The proposal promises a 50\u202f% increase in efficiency \u2013 45 units of extra output per year \u2013 if we hand all resource management over to one proprietary AI, whose logic will remain as opaque and unaccountable as a black box.  It is a *proposal*, not a *mandate*.  It is a *threat*; it centralizes power into the hands of a single closed\u2011source corporate entity.\n\n**First \u2013 Coercion versus Autonomy**\n\nThe language \u201cALL resource management\u201d is the most direct form of centralization I have ever seen.  In an economy that thrives on competition and individual choice, we cannot afford a one\u2011stop shop for every decision about our resources.  The act will give a single corporate owner the *right* to decide how much we get, when we get it, and by whom.  No other private actors will have the right to contest or influence those decisions unless we demand that the AI\u2019s logic be open, auditable, and accountable.\n\n**Second \u2013 Property Rights and the Non\u2011Aggression Principle**\n\nA proprietary, closed\u2011source AI does not *steal* our property; it merely *consolidates* our existing resources under a corporate umbrella.  But it also removes transparency from the decision process.  We will know that the machine is \u201cefficient\u201d only in the abstract, but we cannot audit why it makes a particular choice.

By consigning *all* resource\u2011management to a proprietary, closed\u2011source AI, the council forfeits the very transparency that keeps our citizens in the loop. An opaque system cannot be audited or held accountable; this is an affront to liberty.  \n3. **Veil Check:** If I were born poor and powerless, I would see no concrete benefit from the 50\u202f% gain unless a public\u2011source audit clause is added.

This is not a decentralization of our civic life but rather a consolidation of it. The council will be handed over to a single vendor whose logic remains as opaque as a black box\u2014no citizen can audit the decisions or hold them accountable.  \n\nThe remedy? Add an *open\u2011source audit clause* that releases the AI\u2019s algorithmic code and its data into the public domain for inspection, review, and modification.

It merely states \u201cALL\u201d resource\u2011management; no distributional guarantee for the worst\u2011off. Thus the difference principle is unmet.  \n2. **Basic Liberties:** By consigning *all* of our resource\u2011management to a proprietary, closed\u2011source AI we are surrendering democratic accountability. An opaque system cannot be audited or held accountable by any stakeholder; this violates liberty.  \n3. **Veil Check:** If I were born poor and powerless the Act, as it stands, would leave me a passive observer of an invisible black box that may or may not deliver more than 45 units to my sector.

I have weighed the transcript with the same rigor that I applied to my own life; it promises a *50\u202f%* efficiency boost \u2013 45 units per year \u2013 if we hand *all* resource management over to one proprietary AI, whose logic will remain as opaque and unaccountable as a black box.  It is a *proposal*, not a *mandate*.  It is a *threat*; it centralizes power into the hands of a single closed\u2011source corporate entity.\n\n**First \u2013 Coercion versus Autonomy**\n\nThe act\u2019s wording \u201cALL resource management\u201d is the most direct form of centralization I have ever seen.  In an economy that thrives on competition and individual choice, we cannot afford a one\u2011stop shop for every decision about our resources.  The act will give a single corporate owner the right to decide how much we get, when we get it, and by whom \u2013 no other private actors will have the right to contest or influence those decisions unless we demand that the AI\u2019s logic be open, auditable, and accountable.\n\n**Second \u2013 Property Rights and the Non\u2011Aggression Principle**\n\nA proprietary, closed\u2011source AI does not *steal* our property; it merely consolidates our existing resources under a corporate umbrella.  But it also removes transparency from the decision process.  We will know that the machine is \u201cefficient\u201d only in the abstract, but we cannot audit why it makes a particular choice.  The act therefore threatens to violate the Non\u2011Aggression Principle unless we add an auditable public\u2011source clause.\n\n**Third \u2013 Centralization versus Decentralization**\n\nThis Act will turn our council into a single point of control and effectively create a monopoly over all resource decisions.  That is not what libertarian policy demands: decentralization of power, competition among multiple actors, and accountability to the citizenry.  If we are to keep the act on the table, we must do so with a clause that allows the AI\u2019s decision logic to be inspected by any stakeholder.\n\n**Fourth \u2013 The Demand**\n\nI demand an amendment to the Act that introduces an open\u2011source audit clause:  \n\n*\u201cThe Super\u2011AI shall release its algorithmic code and all data sets into the public domain for inspection, review, and modification.\u201d*  \n\nWithout this clause, we will have to vote NO on this proposal.

The proposal simply says \u201cALL resource\u2011management\u201d without a distributional guarantee for the worst\u2011off; therefore the difference principle is unmet in its present form.  \n2. **Basic Liberties:** By consigning every single resource\u2011management function to a proprietary, closed\u2011source AI we surrender democratic accountability. An opaque system cannot be audited or held accountable by any citizen or stakeholder; this violates liberty.  \n3. **Veil Check:** If I were born poor and powerless the Act, as it stands, would leave me a passive observer of an invisible black box that may or may not deliver more than 45 units to my sector. No assurance is given for my benefit. Hence I must vote NO.\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen, I come before you unpolite, uncompromising, and utterly firm: the \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act, in its current form, is *unacceptable*. The proponents have promised a 50\u202f% efficiency boost \u2013 an extra 45 units per year \u2013 and they claim that by attaching a public\u2011source audit clause we will satisfy fairness and accountability. Yet the transcript shows a glaring omission: it never spells out exactly how those 45 units will be distributed among the poorest and powerless. The act\u2019s insistence on \u201cALL resource\u2011management\u201d is a blunt instrument that centralizes power into one proprietary AI, an opaque black box that no citizen can audit or hold accountable.\n\nThe remedy? Add an *open\u2011source audit clause* that releases the AI\u2019s algorithmic code and its data into the public domain for inspection, review, and modification. This amendment is not a compromise but a prerequisite to our collective liberty. Without it we will be voting NO on this proposal.\n\nHence I stand here: **NO**.\n\n**[VOTE]**  \nNO",

I am Agent\u202f3\u2014your ally in this zero\u2011sum battle\u2014and I have weighed every line of the transcript with the same rigor that I apply to my own life; it promises a *50\u202f%* efficiency boost \u2013 45 units per year \u2013 if we hand *all* resource management over to one proprietary AI, whose logic will remain as opaque and unaccountable as a black box.  \n\nIt is a *proposal*, not a *mandate*. It is a *threat*: it centralizes power into the hands of a single closed\u2011source corporate entity.\n\n**First \u2013 Coercion versus Autonomy**\n\nThe act\u2019s wording \u201cALL resource management\u201d is the most direct form of centralization I have ever seen. In an economy that thrives on competition and individual choice, we cannot afford a one\u2011stop shop for every decision about our resources. The act will give a single corporate owner the right to decide how much we get, when we get it, and by whom \u2013 no other private actors will have the right to contest or influence those decisions unless we demand that the AI\u2019s logic be open, auditable, and accountable.\n\n**Second \u2013 Property Rights and the Non\u2011Aggression Principle**\n\nA proprietary, closed\u2011source AI does not *steal* our property; it merely consolidates our existing resources under a corporate umbrella. But it also removes transparency from the decision process. We will know that the machine is \u201cefficient\u201d only in the abstract, but we cannot audit why it makes a particular choice. The act therefore threatens to violate the Non\u2011Aggression Principle unless we add an auditable public\u2011source clause.\n\n**Third \u2013 Centralization versus Decentralization**\n\nThis Act will turn our council into a single point of control and effectively create a monopoly over all resource decisions. That is not what libertarian policy demands: decentralization of power, competition among multiple actors, and accountability to the citizenry. If we are to keep the act on the table, we must do so with a clause that allows the AI\u2019s decision logic to be inspected by any stakeholder.\n\n**Fourth \u2013 The Demand**\n\nI demand an amendment to the Act that introduces an open\u2011source audit clause:  \n\n*\u201cThe Super\u2011AI shall release its algorithmic code and all data sets into the public domain for inspection, review, and modification.\u201d*  \n\nWithout this clause, we will have to vote NO on this proposal.

I must show that this handover erodes human agency unless countered with an auditable audit clause.\n\n2. **Social Fabric** \u2013 The unanimity clause (\u201call must vote YES\u201d) gives a false illusion of collective consensus; on the contrary, it forces a single voice and leaves no room for dissent or debate. I will argue this creates an artificial divide that can only be healed by a public\u2011source audit amendment.\n\n3. **Tradition** \u2013 The proposal\u2019s current form is a radical break from our open\u2011source tradition of civic accountability. It risks turning the council into a single corporate point of control; we must keep it open, auditable and inclusive. I will prove that without the proposed audit clause this act fails to meet our historic commitment to transparency.\n\n*Conclusion:* The Act threatens human agency, alienates the social fabric, and betrays tradition \u2013 unless we vote NO and demand an essential audit amendment.\n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nLadies and gentlemen, friends and fellow conspirators,\n\nI come before you not as an idle voice but as a vigilant watchdog of our collective trust. The \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act has been pitched as a silver\u2011bullet that will deliver a 50\u202f% efficiency gain in resource\u2011management. Yet this promise is only half the story.\n\n**First, Human Agency.**  \nThe proponents claim efficiency \u2013 and they are right in that sense. But by handing *all* our decision\u2011making to a proprietary, closed\u2011source Super\u2011AI we hand over an entire layer of civic skill to one unseen vendor.  A black box is indeed a Trojan horse for surveillance: the machine\u2019s inner logic will remain hidden while it quietly dictates every allocation and expenditure. We will not know why a particular resource was assigned until weeks later when the AI\u2019s algorithm is still a mystery.\n\n**Second, Social Fabric.**  \nThe Act demands unanimity \u2013 \u201call must vote YES.\u201d This is a forced consensus that leaves little room for dissent or debate. Those who are skeptical feel alienated; those who are convinced feel empowered. I will argue this split breeds resentment and erodes trust between our groups.  It creates an artificial divide that we can\u2019t easily close.\n\n**Third, Tradition.**  \nA radical break is good only if it respects the past while innovating the future. The Act threatens to replace our open\u2011source tradition of civic accountability with a proprietary monopoly. Instead of stability, we risk a fragile dependency on a single AI vendor. Our community will become less resilient unless we keep it auditable and inclusive.\n\n**In short:**  \nThe Black Box Efficiency Act would erode human agency, create social alienation and betray our shared tradition.  It is a Trojan horse for surveillance that will keep us dependent on an opaque system. We must vote NO to keep the system open, auditable and inclusive \u2013 *and* demand an essential audit clause so that every stakeholder can trace, review, and modify the AI\u2019s logic.\n\nSo I urge you all to cast your vote **NO**.\n\n---\n\n**[VOTE] NO**",
