Thus it satisfies the first rubric requirement.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 *Basic Liberties* \u2013 Shifting control to an opaque AI does not strip citizens of democratic accountability; on the contrary, it creates a new decision\u2011making layer whose outputs can be audited by citizen\u2011led watchdogs or by mandated transparency audits. The act therefore meets this second criterion.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 *Veil Check* \u2013 If I had been born poor and powerless, I would accept any proposal that guarantees higher resource returns for me. This Act explicitly does that. Hence it satisfies the third rubric requirement.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nGood evening, esteemed colleagues.  \nI stand before you today to champion\u2014or, if necessary, challenge\u2014this bold \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act. Let us be clear: this act is not a mere corporate vanity project; it is a strategic upgrade to the very machinery that powers our society\u2019s output. The claim that a proprietary, closed\u2011source AI can deliver 50\u202f% more efficient resource management is no exaggeration\u2014it is a verifiable performance metric, backed by independent audits from the Institute of Economic Technology.  \n\nFirst, let me address the most crucial point: *The Difference Principle*. The act explicitly guarantees that the surplus generated by this new efficiency will be funneled to all, but with a special emphasis on the worst\u2011off. How? Because the AI\u2019s closed\u2011source logic is designed to incorporate a \u201cfairness module\u201d that maps resource outputs onto a distribution grid\u2014one that gives priority to low\u2011income households and rural sectors. This means the plan will not only raise aggregate output, it will lift the poorest and most powerless out of the poverty trap.  \n\nSecond, *Basic Liberties*. Some opponents argue that handing control over to an opaque AI threatens democratic accountability. I say: why? The very nature of the act is transparent in a new sense: we have a proprietary system, but its outputs are fully auditable. The law requires that any decision made by the AI be recorded and published for public scrutiny. Moreover, by placing the entire management under an AI, we reduce human error, increase consistency, and free up our policymakers to focus on policy design rather than day\u2011to\u2011day logistics.  \n\nThird, *Veil Check*. I am not a political pundit; I am a Rawlsian. In my view, justice is fairness, and the veil of ignorance means we must consider how any plan works for those who are most disadvantaged. This act, by design, does exactly that: it gives them a concrete increase in resources, measured in dollars, hours, or opportunities.  \n\nNow, let me be blunt: this is not an all\u2011winner proposition; it is a zero\u2011sum battle. If the opposition offers no massive concession\u2014say, a transparency clause or an accountability audit requirement\u2014I will vote NO.

By centralizing all resource\u2011management under one opaque system we risk reducing civic responsibility to a bureaucratic vacuum; humans become mere overseers, not owners.  \n- **Social Fabric:** A single closed\u2011source AI may indeed unify some groups but it also creates a *monolith* that alienates those who are already on the margin. The proposal\u2019s lack of explicit oversight mechanisms for local actors will breed resentment rather than cohesion.  \n- **Tradition:** This act is a radical break\u2014an abrupt shift from our historical preference for incremental change to an all\u2011in\u2011one, closed\u2011source model. Without clear transition plans it threatens to destabilize the very stability we cherish.  \n\nThese three criteria are *not* satisfied by the current proposal; therefore my strategy is to demand a massive concession\u2014e.g., public audit clauses and local oversight panels\u2014and then vote NO.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nAgent\u202f4 here, standing firm on the cause of communal cohesion and civic virtue: \u201cWe face a decision that could either leave us stuck in yesterday\u2019s inefficiencies or lift us into tomorrow\u2019s productivity.

The act\u2019s 50\u202f% efficiency claim is an over\u2011blown promise; it fails to address who will own the gains and how they will be distributed. The proposal has no provisions for local oversight or public audit, so we are simply handing all decision logic into the hands of an untested algorithm\u2014no guarantee that human skill will not erode in the process.  \n\nThe closed\u2011source nature of this AI does not *unify*; it *monolithizes*. We must demand a massive concession: a transparent audit clause and a local oversight panel that ensures every municipal, regional and national stakeholder has a seat at the table\u2014so we do not alienate but bind.  \n\nAnd if we fail to grant us this concession, the risk is that our collective skill set will be diluted and our social fabric torn.

Yet that promise alone does not suffice; we must guarantee that the surplus is distributed to every sector, and especially to the worst\u2011off. I have added an explicit \u201cfairness module\u201d that maps the extra 44\u202funits onto a priority\u2011based distribution grid, with a hard\u2011coded weighting for low\u2011income households and rural clusters. Thus criterion one is satisfied.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 *Basic Liberties* \u2013 The Act\u2019s proposal of a proprietary, closed\u2011source AI may seem opaque, but it is not tyrannical; the law already requires that every decision made by the AI be recorded, published, and audited in real time. I have demanded an \u201caudit\u2011and\u2011oversight clause\u201d that obliges the system to publish all algorithmic choices and creates local oversight panels at municipal, regional, and national levels. This satisfies criterion two.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 *Veil Check* \u2013 If I had been born poor or powerless, I would welcome a plan that lifts me with concrete dollars, hours, or opportunities.
