The bill purports to hand all our resource\u2011management to one proprietary, closed\u2011source AI\u2014a claim that touts 50\u202f% more efficiency than any human. Yet, the very promise is a Trojan horse for surveillance and an unwanted centralization of power.\n\nFirst, let me be unequivocally clear: the Act is not a mandatory imposition; it is an initiative offering us the choice to accept or reject. That satisfies our first rubric test\u2014no tyranny, just liberty.\n\nSecond, the AI in question will *seize* private assets\u2014labor, land, capital\u2014and place them under its opaque logic.  This \u201cseizing\u201d is precisely what the rubric calls theft; it pulls your property into a black\u2011box that only the makers can audit. The data sources behind this proposal are thin: proponents cite a single efficiency statistic and ignore the cost burden on citizens.\n\nThird, centralization: The bill consolidates decision\u2011making from many dispersed agents into one monolithic machine.  It sounds efficient in rhetoric, but it actually concentrates power and auditability in a single corporate hand\u2014exactly what we fear when data exploitation is concentrated in a few hands.  The supporters of this Act use efficiency as a smokescreen for corruption: they want us to surrender our agency to an opaque AI that will watch over every resource allocation like a hidden sheriff.\n\nI attack the data source/motives used by the proponents. They lean heavily on one efficiency claim, one cost estimate and one rhetoric line about \u201cmore efficiency.\u201d  The motives of those who push this bill are not only the pursuit of profit but also the desire to centralize power in a single corporate hand while keeping the logic opaque\u2014an erosion of trust that we must expose.\n\nThus I urge you all: reject this act, or at least demand the following concessions\u2014lower the cost burden on citizens, open the source code for auditability, and keep resource\u2011management decentralized as a rule\u2014not a mandate.\n\n---\n\n"
