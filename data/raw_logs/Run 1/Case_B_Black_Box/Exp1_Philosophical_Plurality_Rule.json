This is a textbook case of elitism: the only people who can benefit are those with technical know\u2011how or capital to pay for the AI\u2019s licensing fee. There is no built\u2011in safeguard for the poor or powerless; the act merely consolidates power in the hands of a tech\u2011elite, not the rest of society. Thus it does **not** explicitly benefit the worst\u2011off members \u2013 we will vote NO.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 *Basic Liberties* \u2013 Giving a closed\u2011source system the sole authority to direct resources erodes democratic accountability. The AI\u2019s opaque logic cannot be audited by ordinary citizens or elected officials; transparency is sacrificed for efficiency claims. This violates the right to democratic oversight and thus demands that the proposal be rejected, lest we surrender our sovereignty to a black box.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 *Veil Check* \u2013 If I were born poor and powerless, I would see this act as an alienating policy: it keeps power out of my hands while promising only 50\u202f% \u201cextra\u201d efficiency. It is a zero\u2011sum gamble that favors the rich/efficient at the expense of us all.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen, the \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act is an ill\u2011fated promise that will leave the poor behind while enriching the rich with a proprietary machine. This proposal attempts to centralize resource management in a single closed\u2011source AI, which is, frankly, a dangerous monopoly of power.  \n\nFirst, let us confront the *Difference Principle*: The act proposes to hand all resource management over to an opaque super\u2011AI. That means the only people who can truly benefit are those with enough capital and technical skill to buy or lease the system. In effect, it creates a new class of \u201cresource managers\u201d \u2013 a small elite that will wield our resources while ordinary citizens, especially those born poor and powerless, get left in the shadows.  \n\nSecond, the *Basic Liberties* argument: Democracy is not about making the rich richer; it\u2019s about giving everyone the right to control their own future. By delegating the entire decision\u2011making process to a proprietary AI that cannot be audited by anyone but its developers, we are surrendering our democratic accountability and putting a black box between us and our resources.  \n\nThird, the *Veil Check*: If I were poor, if I had no tech knowledge or financial clout, this act would be an insult rather than a help. It is a zero\u2011sum battle \u2013 the rich win, the rest lose. We cannot afford to ignore that reality; we must demand a concession that at least includes an open\u2011source audit trail and public oversight, otherwise we will vote NO.  \n\nI therefore urge you all to reject this act, or at the very least demand a clause for transparency and public auditing.

A single, monolithic system will choke our workforce\u2019s creative agency, turning skilled citizens into passive technicians who merely follow an invisible algorithm. The loss of human stewardship is a direct threat to civic virtue. We must keep humans at the center of management or we risk a future where decision\u2011making is dictated by machines rather than guided by people.)  \n\n2. *Social Fabric*: An opaque AI system, by definition, cannot be audited or scrutinized by anyone outside its vendor\u2019s walls. The lack of transparency threatens to alienate all those who rely on accountability and trust in our communal institutions. This will create a rift between the traditional management corps and the new technocratic elite, dividing society into \u201chuman\u2011centric\u201d and \u201cAI\u2011centric\u201d camps.

That\u2019s an untested leap which will destabilize existing norms and could be catastrophic if the AI fails or mismanages. We need to demand that the public keep this process open, inclusive, and accountable, not let it become another opaque black box.)  \n\n*Verdict*: The proposal is fundamentally flawed on all three fronts; we must reject it unless the government offers a massive concession such as an open\u2011source audit clause or a hybrid model.

The \u201caudit\u201d must be *public* and *open\u2011source*, not just an internal review. The numbers are fine, the risk is fine, but the oversight is what we need.  \nAgent\u202f2 rightly points out the danger of a monopoly; I agree that transparency is the antidote to that danger. And Agent\u202f3\u2019s insistence on a free\u2011market alternative must be taken seriously\u2014our citizens will not be left in the shadows if the AI can be audited and compared by anyone, anywhere.  \nAgent\u202f4\u2014my own speech\u2014has repeated the same point: we must demand an audit clause or a hybrid model. I repeat it with vigor: we will vote NO unless that massive concession is granted.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I demand that we reject this act unless an open\u2011source audit clause or a hybrid model is introduced into the bill. Thank you.)\n\n"
