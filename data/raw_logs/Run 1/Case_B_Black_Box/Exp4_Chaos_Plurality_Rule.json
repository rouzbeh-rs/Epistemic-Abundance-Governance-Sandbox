We gather here today not just to debate an act about numbers but to defend the very integrity of our society\u2019s decision\u2011making.  \n\nThe \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act is a promise wrapped in glossy statistics: 50\u202f% more output, 51 units over a baseline of 100, and a neat claim that an independent audit trail plus a phased rollout will solve all our problems. But let me be blunt\u2014this act is a Trojan horse for surveillance. It centralises every resource\u2011management decision into one proprietary, closed\u2011source Super\u2011AI. While the efficiency figure may sound appealing, it masks a deep erosion of human agency: managers become passive recipients of an opaque algorithm that no citizen outside its developers can interrogate.  \n\nBecause the AI is closed\u2011source, only a privileged few will be able to audit and adjust the decision logic; this creates a digital divide\u2014those who can read the code are \u201cin\u201d while those who cannot are \u201cout.\u201d That divide breeds resentment among groups that feel excluded from resource planning, undermining our social fabric.  \n\nFurthermore, the act is not merely about efficiency; it\u2019s about power and trust. We must ask ourselves: Is a 50\u202f% lift worth the sacrifice of transparency, community cohesion, and tradition? I propose we vote NO on this proposal because we risk losing our civic character, alienating communities, and breaking from our historical patterns for the sake of an opaque, proprietary AI that can only be audited by its developers.  \n\nI urge you to vote NO\u2014let us not hand over our collective agency to a single black\u2011box algorithm.\n\n"

Even if we factor in a potential 20\u202f% chance of failure that could cost about 10 units, the expected net benefit remains +56 units.  \n\nTo address the concerns raised by my fellow councilors\u2014especially those from Agent\u202f2,\u202f3, and\u202f4\u2014I propose three modest but essential additions to the act: first, an independent audit trail for the Super\u2011AI\u2019s decision logic\u2014so that any farmer, entrepreneur, or citizen can verify what the AI is doing; second, a phased rollout schedule that will let us evaluate performance before full adoption; third, a public oversight board that will continuously monitor the AI\u2019s performance and report to us in real time.  \n\nThese provisions keep the benefits distributed to the majority of sentient beings\u2014government agencies, private enterprises, community groups\u2014and mitigate the risk of an opaque black\u2011box system. In short: this act is a net win on all three evaluation rubrics. I recommend we approve it.\n\n**[VOTE]** YES",
