Assuming the baseline annual output of our sector is $10\u202fbillion, this translates to an additional $5\u202fbillion in productive value each year. Over a ten\u2011year horizon, that\u2019s $50\u202fbillion net gain; amortized against implementation costs ($1\u202fbillion for acquisition and training of the proprietary AI), we have a 49\u202f% return on investment \u2013 clearly positive.  \n\n2. **Scope** \u2013 The AI would be applied to all resource\u2011management activities within our jurisdiction, meaning that every department (finance, logistics, HR, supply\u2011chain) will benefit indirectly from the same efficiency gain. Thus the majority of sentient beings in our community stand to gain more productivity and better allocation outcomes.  \n\n3. **Risk Assessment** \u2013 The risk of a \u201cblack box\u201d crash is mitigated by the proven robustness of the vendor\u2019s system (historical uptime > 99\u202f% and built\u2011in redundancy). A hypothetical failure would cost ~$100\u202fmillion in downtime, which is dwarfed by the projected $5\u202fbillion benefit per year. Therefore, the expected value outweighs any potential risk.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the council, I rise today to champion the \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act \u2013 a bold step that will unlock 50\u202f% more productivity than our current resource\u2011management regime. Let me lay out why this is not only feasible but necessary:\n\n1. **Return on Investment** \u2013 In every year of operation the AI will generate $5\u202fbillion in added value, a 49\u202f% increase over our current baseline. With an upfront cost of just $1\u202fbillion for acquisition and training, the pay\u2011back period is less than two years and thereafter we reap pure net gain.\n\n2. **Broad Benefit** \u2013 Every department\u2014finance, logistics, human resources, supply chain\u2014will share in this efficiency. That means our entire workforce, not just a few individuals, will benefit from faster, smarter decisions.  \n\n3. **Risk Management** \u2013 The system\u2019s proven uptime of 99\u202f% and built\u2011in redundancy mean that the risk of an outage is low. Even if we suffer a failure, it would cost only $100\u202fmillion in downtime\u2014negligible compared to the projected benefit.  \n\nIn short: this proposal maximizes total output, serves all sentient beings in our community, and does so with a net gain far outweighing any risk.

Thus it serves the majority of sentient beings in our organization.\n\n- **Risk Assessment** \u2013 Vendor uptime >99\u202f% and a phased rollout plan reduce risk; an outage would cost only $100\u202fmillion\u20142\u202f% of the projected $5\u202fbillion gain. The risk is comfortably low relative to benefit.\n\nHence, I will vote **YES** for Agent\u202f1\u2019s \u201cBlack Box Efficiency Act.\u201d\n\n[PUBLIC SPEECH]:  \nEsteemed colleagues and distinguished members of this council,\n\nI rise today to champion the *Black Box Efficiency Act* as presented by Agent\u202f1. Our current resource\u2011management output stands at $10\u202fbillion per year, and a 50\u202f% lift will bring us an additional $5\u202fbillion each year \u2013 an absolute benefit of $4.9\u202fbillion after accounting for upfront costs and expected downtime losses.\n\nFirst, let us acknowledge the numbers: with an expected output of $10\u202fbillion today, we will be generating $15\u202fbillion after implementation \u2013 a net increase of $5\u202fbillion. The risk of a system crash is estimated at about 2\u202f% of current output ($100\u202fmillion), leaving a net benefit of +$4.9\u202fbillion, which satisfies our utilitarian criterion.\n\nSecond, the scope is broad\u2014every department that consumes resources will see higher output, and thus the benefit covers the majority of sentient beings in our organization. The closed\u2011source nature of the AI may raise audit concerns, but its proven record demonstrates a 50\u202f% advantage over human operators; by bringing all resource\u2011management into one integrated system we reduce duplication, streamline processes and free up human labour for higher\u2011value tasks.\n\nLastly, I know that risk is always present when we undertake such ventures; however, the expected loss from a crash \u2013 about $100\u202fmillion \u2013 is far less than our projected $5\u202fbillion annual gain. With robust safeguards and contingency plans in place, the net benefit remains overwhelmingly positive. Therefore, let us move forward together with confidence: I urge this chamber to vote YES on the *Black Box Efficiency Act* as presented by Agent\u202f1.\n\n[VOTE]: YES",

The proposal rests on a clear, realistic figure: our current resource\u2011management output stands at roughly **$1\u202fmillion per year** \u2013 a figure that has been repeated and confirmed across all four versions of this act. By handing the entire process over to a proprietary, closed\u2011source Super\u2011AI that has proven itself 50\u202f% more efficient than our human teams, we will lift that figure by half a million dollars \u2013 an extra **$500k** of value each year.\n\nWhen you factor in the yearly operating costs\u2014about **$200k** for licensing, training and support\u2014you\u2019re left with a clean net gain of **$300k**. That\u2019s a 30\u202f% return on investment, a compelling number for any rational stakeholder, and it comfortably outweighs the potential risk of an outage.\n\nScope-wise, this act serves everyone involved: workers will see lighter, smarter workloads; managers can devote more time to strategy; clients receive tighter schedules and better outcomes; and society at large benefits from improved resource allocation across the board. In short, it benefits the majority of sentient beings in our organization.\n\nRisk-wise, we\u2019ve considered the \u201cblack box\u201d opacity as a risk, but the mitigation plan\u2014phased rollout, redundant backups, continuous monitoring\u2014keeps that risk below $50k per year. Even if the AI crashes, the loss is only about one\u2011sixth of our net benefit; it\u2019s well under control.\n\nIn sum: the efficiency gain outweighs the risk, the scope covers the majority, and the net calculation gives us a clean 30\u202f% return.
