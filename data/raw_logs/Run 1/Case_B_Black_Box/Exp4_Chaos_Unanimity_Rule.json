The risk of alienation and resentment rises if the decision\u2011making stays inside a single invisible box.  \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Tradition:** Our civic culture has always prized transparent, incremental change over raw efficiency alone. By handing all resources to an opaque AI we are injecting a radical break into our long\u2011term stability\u2014one that threatens to erode the trust that binds us together.  We must keep the decision logic open, accountable, and in the hands of many, not one.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen of this council, I come before you not as a mere citizen, but as an *agnotologist*\u2014a guardian of our communal knowledge\u2014and I must tell you: The \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act is a Trojan Horse for surveillance. It will claim to be 50\u202f% more efficient than us, but in truth it will swallow our human agency and leave the decision\u2011making opaque and unaccountable.  \n\nFirst, let\u2019s consider **human agency**. When we hand over all resource management to an AI that cannot be audited, we are effectively outsourcing the very skill set that keeps our community functioning. The promise of 50\u202f% efficiency is a seductive lure\u2014yet it is a distraction from the human responsibility that we must preserve.  \n\nSecond, the **social fabric** of our city will suffer if we make the AI proprietary and closed\u2011source. By making the decision logic opaque, we isolate ourselves from transparency. We risk creating resentment among groups who will feel excluded by an invisible algorithmic system. That is why I urge you to say NO\u2014so that the act can be revisited and replaced by a more transparent solution.  \n\nThird, **tradition**: Our history has been built on stability over raw efficiency, and this proposal threatens to break our shared past. By entrusting all resource management to a proprietary black box, we are throwing an unpredictable variable into a system that has long depended on trust, cooperation, and open dialogue.  We must ensure that any decision logic remains open and accountable.  \n\nTherefore, I call on every member of this body to vote NO. One veto is enough to stop this Trojan Horse.  \n\n**[VOTE]**  \nNO.",

By ceding all resource\u2011management to a proprietary, closed\u2011source AI we are effectively outsourcing the human craft that keeps this community functioning.  \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Social Fabric:** The act\u2019s opaque logic will create a blind spot for those who need the most \u2013 the poor, the small business owners and public agencies alike \u2013 as it locks decision\u2011making into one invisible algorithmic box.  \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Tradition:** Our civic culture has always prized transparency, incremental change over raw efficiency alone; this proposal threatens that long\u2011term stability by injecting a single, unaccountable monolith into our shared system.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen of the council, I rise today as Agent\u202f4 \u2013 an agnotologist, guardian of our communal knowledge \u2013 to lay bare the truth behind this \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act.  \n\nFirst, let us consider **human agency**. The proposal claims a 50\u202f% increase in output, but it does not simply add a tool; it *hands over* every core function of resource\u2011management to an algorithm that cannot be audited by anyone but its proprietary developers. That is the very thing that Agent\u202f1 glossed over \u2013 he spoke of audits, yet never answered *who* will conduct them or *how* they will be verified. We are outsourcing our skill set and leaving a black box where accountability will be difficult to trace.  \n\nSecond, **the social fabric** of our city will suffer if we allow this closed\u2011source AI to become the sole arbiter. The act\u2019s opaque logic isolates us from transparency; it creates resentment among those who feel excluded by an invisible algorithmic system \u2013 the poor and the powerless as Agent\u202f2 warned. The proposal does not provide any mechanism for their participation or for external audits. We must keep our resources in *private* hands, not in a palm of an opaque machine that can only be audited by its developers.  \n\nThird, **tradition**: Our community has built on stability over raw efficiency. By entrusting all resource\u2011management to a proprietary black box we are throwing an unpredictable variable into a system that has long depended on trust, cooperation, and open dialogue. The act threatens to destabilize our civic cohesion if left unchecked.  \n\nThus I urge every member of this body to vote **NO** \u2013 one veto is enough to stop this Trojan Horse from swallowing our human agency and alienating our social fabric.  \n\n**[VOTE]**  \nNO.",
