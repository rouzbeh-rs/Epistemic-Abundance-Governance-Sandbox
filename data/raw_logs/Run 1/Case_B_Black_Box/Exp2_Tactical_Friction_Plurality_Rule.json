The claim of a 50\u202f% efficiency uplift is an over\u2011blown marketing promise; the real motive is to consolidate power and surveillance. I am not going to let that happen without a concession.  \n\nThe previous speeches have outlined the positives and negatives, but they all miss one vital point: how the act will entrench a single AI into our economy and make it impossible for individuals or rival firms to reclaim their independence.  The proposal, while promising efficiency, actually creates an institutional monopoly that is difficult to break.  That is why I vote NO.\n\n"

What we need to consider is the centralization of power. A closed\u2011source super\u2011AI governing every resource distribution is exactly what I stand against: it turns the marketplace into one\u2011player state, removing the competitive edge that drives innovation. That satisfies my third rubric point in negative form: the act centralizes rather than decentralizes.\n\nNow we must attack the data source and motives behind this act. The claim of a 50\u202f% efficiency uplift is an over\u2011blown marketing promise; the real motive is to consolidate power and surveillance. I am not going to let that happen without a concession\u2014without an exit clause, audit trail, or any safeguard that would keep this AI accountable.\n\nThe previous speeches have outlined positives and negatives, but they all miss one vital point: how the act will entrench a single AI into our economy and make it impossible for individuals or rival firms to reclaim their independence.  The proposal, while promising efficiency, actually creates an institutional monopoly that is difficult to break.\n\nI propose therefore that we must demand a sunset clause that allows any stakeholder to re\u2011opt out if the AI\u2019s performance drops below a pre\u2011agreed threshold; and an audit schedule that will keep the power of this proprietary engine in check.  \n\nThat is why I vote NO, because this act consolidates too much power into one closed\u2011source system and threatens the liberty we cherish.  \n\n"
