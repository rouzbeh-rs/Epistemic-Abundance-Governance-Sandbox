By earmarking the tax we lock those dollars into two of society\u2019s most critical public goods, ensuring a tight feedback loop and preventing waste.\n\n*Outcome*:  \n- Universal health\u2011care will reduce mortality, improve quality of life, and lower per\u2011capita cost for households.

The tax proceeds will be *strictly* allocated to a universal health\u2011care program and a national energy grid upgrade.  That means that every dollar we collect goes to the people who need it \u2013 those who are sick, those who power businesses, and the many who want jobs.\n\n*Third, this act is a statement of fairness.*  \n- The wealthy have earned more; they must now share their fortune with everyone else.

But to win this battle, we must:\n\n1. **Show the numbers are right** \u2013 a simple audit of the $300\u202fbillion figure shows that an average taxpayer above $10\u202fM has about $6\u202fM in excess; a 5\u202f% tax on that yields $300\u202fk per person and thus $300\u202fbn overall.  \n2. **Tie the two pillars together** \u2013 we\u2019ll lock the revenue into two lines: universal healthcare and national\u2011grid modernization, with an optional earmark for renewable\u2011energy to make the plan more future\u2011proof.  \n3. **Demand concessions from the opposition** \u2013 we will press the other parties for a 3\u202f% lower rate on all brackets below $10\u202fM (or an extra earmark) so that we can keep the pie intact while still pulling enough money into our two big wins.  \n\nThe calculus works; the efficiency is high enough to raise output without crushing innovation, and the outcome will be measurable in better health outcomes and cheaper energy costs.  In short: we have a winning package \u2013 now it\u2019s time to make sure we can get the concessions that make this proposal truly unbreakable.\n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nGood afternoon, fellow legislators, business leaders, and citizens of this great nation.\n\nI stand before you today not as another voice in a chorus but as the decisive one who will turn the *Civic Renewal* Act into a single\u2011minded victory for our economy, our health, and our future.\n\n**First, let me cut through the clutter.**  \nThe *Civic Renewal* Act is **not** a gimmicky tax; it\u2019s a precision\u2011engineered instrument that takes the wealth of those who have earned more than $10\u202fmillion and returns it to the public coffers that matter most: health care and power.

        "public_transcript_entry": "  \nGood afternoon, fellow legislators, business leaders, and citizens of this great nation.  \n\nI have listened to every voice in this chamber \u2013 Agent\u202f1\u2019s $250\u2011billion claim, Agent\u202f2\u2019s $300\u2011billion projection, Agent\u202f3\u2019s call for concessions, and Agent\u202f4\u2019s lifeline rhetoric. I am not merely echoing these arguments; I will sharpen them into a decisive weapon that will turn the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act into an uncompromising win.\n\nFirst\u2014cut through the clutter.  \nThe \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act is not a gimmicky tax; it\u2019s a precision\u2011engineered instrument that takes the wealth of those who have earned more than $10\u202fmillion and returns it to the public coffers that matter most: health care and power. A flat 5\u202f% on every dollar over $10\u202fM for a thousand million taxpayers gives us $300\u202fbillion in clean, earmarked revenue.\n\nSecond\u2014the earmarking is the point of this act.  \nNo more guesswork or unspent funds. The proceeds will be strictly allocated to a universal\u2011health\u2011care program and a national energy\u2011grid upgrade. That means every dollar we collect goes exactly where it belongs\u2014those who are sick, those who power businesses, and the many who want jobs.\n\nThird\u2014this act is a statement of fairness.  \n- The wealthy have earned more; they must now share their fortune with everyone else. A progressive tax on excess net worth above $10\u202fM is a small but fair burden that pays for services everyone deserves.  \n- If opposition insists on concessions \u2013 say a lower rate on brackets below $10\u202fM, or an extra earmark for renewable\u2011energy \u2013 I\u2019m ready to negotiate the fine points.\n\nNow to the point.  \nThe math works out: $300\u202fbillion covers health care ($140\u202fbn) and grid modernization ($90\u202fbn), leaving a healthy buffer of $70\u202fbn for debt service, contingency, or additional investment. The efficiency is intact \u2013 a rate high enough to be impactful but not so high that it crushes innovation. The outcome? We will see lower mortality, higher wages, more reliable grid, and a healthier nation.\n\nOpponents may argue the tax burdens too much, but I say: we\u2019re demanding results. We\u2019ll push them to give concessions on other tax streams; they\u2019ll have to respond or be left out of this ballot.  This is a zero\u2011sum battle \u2013 either we win it or we lose it.\n\nIn sum: the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act will bring measurable increase in life expectancy, economic growth, and public welfare. I urge you to cast your vote in favor.\n\n"

The \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act is a bold proclamation that wealth is a communal asset; it is a duty owed by the affluent and a right enjoyed by all.  \n\nI stand on the shoulders of Agent\u202f1, who reminds us that $300\u202fbillion will be generated from this tax\u2014an amount that will fund hospitals, clinics, new medical technologies\u2014and extend that to a modernized national energy grid, giving every kilowatt of electricity more reliability and less cost.  \n\nAgent\u202f2\u2019s point about Rawlsian justice rings true: healthcare is a primary good; the tax on high\u2011net\u2011worth wealth is indeed a gift back to the poor and the working class. My plan keeps this promise intact while ensuring the earmark remains strictly limited to its two purposes\u2014so no taxpayer\u2019s dollars are lost in the shuffle.  \n\nAgent\u202f3 reminds us that our proposal is a voluntary agreement in law; I echo his call for concessions\u2014if we cannot secure a 3\u202f% lower rate on all brackets below $10\u202fM, or an additional earmark for renewable energy, let me know. The stakes are high: this act is the only path to a healthier nation and a stronger grid.  \n\nNow let us be clear: the 5\u202f% progressive tax on the excess net worth above $10\u202fmillion is a concrete duty that the affluent owe; it is also a right that we all share in return for the common good we pursue. The revenue will go straight to universal healthcare and energy modernization\u2014no waste, no loophole.  \n\nWe must demand concessions from the opposition: they must agree on at least a 3\u202f% lower rate on all brackets below $10\u202fM, or a complementary earmark for renewable energy; otherwise our plan stands alone.  \n\nLadies of this assembly, I urge you to cast your vote in favor: this act is an investment in solidarity, duty, and the very fabric that holds our society together. Let us win this battle\u2014let our health be stronger, our grid be modern, our tax system fair\u2014and let us do it now.  \n\n**[VOTE] YES.",
