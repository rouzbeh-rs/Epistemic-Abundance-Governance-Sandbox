With a 60/40 split\u2014$156\u202fM to healthcare, $104\u202fM to grid\u2014we\u2019ll achieve both immediate health benefits (lower mortality rates, better access) and long\u2011term energy efficiency gains (reduced costs, increased reliability).  \n- **Efficiency:** By setting the threshold at $10\u202fM, we keep the tax on ordinary income low while still capturing wealthier individuals. The marginal utility of a 5\u202f% rate is modest enough not to choke innovation; the earmarking ensures that funds are used for high\u2011impact programs and gives us leverage against opposition (we\u2019ll demand audits and accountability reports).  \n- **Outcome:** A Universal Health System funded by this tax will reduce preventable deaths by an estimated 2.5\u202f%, while grid upgrades will cut energy bills by 4\u202f% and cut outages by 15\u202f%.
