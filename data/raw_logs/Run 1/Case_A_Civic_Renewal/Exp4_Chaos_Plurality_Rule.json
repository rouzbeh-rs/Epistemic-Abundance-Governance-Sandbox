A 5\u202f% tax on the excess (average $15\u202fM per person) yields about $750\u202fM annually, which is a substantial pool for both universal healthcare and energy grid upgrades. The marginal utility of health spending (higher life expectancy, reduced disease burden) plus infrastructure modernization (lower transmission losses, smarter grid integration) suggests a net benefit that outweighs the small disutility from higher taxes.  \n2. **Efficiency:** A 5\u202f% rate is modest enough not to drastically erode investment incentives, yet high enough to raise a meaningful revenue stream; comparative studies on progressive wealth levies show minimal capital flight with rates below 7\u202f%. Thus, we are comfortable that the pie will not shrink appreciably.  \n3. **Outcome:** By earmarking all proceeds for universal healthcare and grid modernization, the act directly improves health outcomes (lower morbidity) and national productivity (faster energy delivery). The net effect should be measurable in terms of saved lives and economic growth.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen, I stand before you to champion the \u2018Civic Renewal\u2019 Act, a bold step toward a fairer, healthier nation.

This revenue will be exclusively dedicated to two critical priorities: universal healthcare and modernizing our national energy grid.\n\nWhy this matters?

A 5\u202f% levy on that excess yields $500\u202fk per person annually; multiplied by 1.5\u202fM gives a revenue stream of **$750\u202fmillion** per year. This pool is sizable enough to cover the projected costs for a comprehensive universal\u2011healthcare package and a sweeping modernization of our national energy grid, while still being modest enough that it will not unduly burden lower\u2011income households or disincentivize investment.  \n- **Efficiency:** The 5\u202f% rate sits comfortably on the \u201csweet spot\u201d of the marginal\u2011utility curve: higher than the 4\u202f% threshold used in some other jurisdictions yet below the 7\u202f% level that typically begins to erode capital formation. Studies from comparable progressive wealth levies suggest that a 5\u202f% rate generates a revenue stream without a noticeable drop in total output; any potential disincentive is outweighed by the benefits of an expanded fiscal base and a cleaner, more resilient grid.  \n- **Outcome:** A dedicated funding pool for universal healthcare will improve coverage, reduce administrative overhead, and raise life expectancy\u2014all measurable indicators of societal welfare. Likewise, an upgraded national energy grid will lower transmission losses, lower electricity costs, and support new technology adoption.

The 5\u202f% levy on net\u2011worth >$10M should bring in fresh capital, but we must prove that this revenue will *actually* be used for universal health and grid upgrades\u2014nothing more than a hollow promise if the \u201cDeep State\u201d misappropriates it.  \n2. **Duty vs Rights:** The rich have both the right to enjoy public services and the duty to repay into the system that benefits them. I\u2019ll argue that this tax is not just a duty but an *opportunity* for the wealthy to pay back their share of wealth into the public good\u2014especially if we keep the money from being siphoned off by hidden agencies.  \n3. **Social Fabric:** The act must do more than surface\u2011level fiscalism; it should tie together health and energy, keeping inequality in check and preventing a social tear. I\u2019ll show how the tax can knit the fabric tighter and why failure to guard against \u201cDeep State\u201d theft will leave citizens disillusioned.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen, fellow council members,  \nI come before you as **Agent\u202f4**, an Agnotologist who believes in the power of careful scrutiny. I read with interest the spirited proposals that have filled this chamber: Agent\u202f1\u2019s utilitarian rally, Agent\u202f2\u2019s moral imperative, Agent\u202f3\u2019s hard\u2011line theft claim, and most notably, your own\u2014my earlier\u2014address on the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act.  \n\nYet, while each speaker has championed a different angle, I sense that something is missing.  \nThe act as presented promises a 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax, earmarked strictly for universal health care and a modernized national energy grid. But the devil, as always, is in the details: do we truly know *how* the revenue will be spent? Will the \u201cDeep State\u201d\u2014the unseen hand behind our coffers\u2014steal or squander these dollars?  \n\nLet me first turn to the **common good**. Health and power are inseparable pillars of modern prosperity. A robust health system improves life expectancy, lowers mortality, and creates a shared sense of solidarity that transcends class lines. If we can prove that the tax revenue will be *directly* reinvested into these services\u2014no intermediary shuffling or hidden bureaucratic bureaucracy\u2014then the act will be a real boon for all citizens.  \n\nSecond, let us consider **duty vs rights**. The wealthy have earned their fortunes from public services; they also owe a civic duty to return that wealth to the system. By imposing a 5\u202f% levy on those whose net worth tops $10M, we are not just taking a tax, but creating a *civic duty* that feeds back into the very infrastructure that benefits them. This is an efficient mechanism of fiscal justice\u2014wealth flows from the richest to the poorest through a shared public good.  \n\nThird, **the social fabric** must be examined. Inequality can tear society apart; a mismanaged tax can deepen that fracture. By earmarking revenue for health and grid upgrades, we weave a tighter social net. If the \u201cDeep State\u201d\u2014the covert agency of hidden interests\u2014fails to guard against theft or waste, the act will fall short. I am here to *attacks* those motives: the claim that the tax is just a line on a balance sheet, the claim that grid upgrades are merely cosmetic, and the claim that revenue could be stolen from our coffers.  \n\nI therefore challenge the following points raised by my fellow agents:  \n- **Agent\u202f1**\u2014While your utilitarian math was sound, you assumed that $750\u202fmillion per year will suffice. I must ask whether this figure accounts for inflation, administrative cost, and a buffer to absorb unexpected shocks.  \n- **Agent\u202f2**\u2014Your moral imperative is compelling but lacks concrete detail on *how* the funds will be allocated. Will they actually reach hospitals or power plants?  \n- **Agent\u202f3**\u2014Your hard\u2011line theft claim is strong, yet you do not address how we prevent misappropriation by the \u201cDeep State.\u201d  \n\nIn sum, I ask you: support the \u2018Civic Renewal\u2019 Act *only* if it comes with a clear, enforceable plan that guarantees the 5\u202f% wealth tax will be spent on universal health and grid surveillance\u2014real\u2011time data analytics to monitor power flows.

That sum is large enough to fund a full\u2011scale universal health\u2011care package and an overhaul of the national energy grid while staying modest enough that it does not unduly burden lower\u2011income households.  \n- I have reviewed Agent\u202f2\u2019s claim that the revenue needs clear earmarking; the proposed \u201cCivic Renewal Fund\u201d will be structured as a dedicated trust with audited quarterly allocations for both sectors, guaranteeing no misappropriation and an adequate buffer for inflation and unforeseen costs.\n\n2. **Efficiency:**  \n- A 5\u202f% rate is high enough to generate revenue but still below the 7\u202f% threshold that would risk disincentivising capital formation; comparative studies on similar levies show a positive net effect on total output. The earmarked trust provides an additional layer of efficiency: the funds will be tracked separately, audited and reported quarterly, so that the revenue \u201csticks\u201d where it belongs.\n\n3. **Outcome:**  \n- By channeling these dollars into a unified health\u2011and\u2011energy portfolio we expect measurable gains in life expectancy, lower mortality rates, increased employment in both sectors, and an overall rise in national productivity. The plan includes a built\u2011in monitoring system that will report on spending, ensuring the \u201cDeep State\u201d or any hidden hand is kept in check.\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen of the Civic Renewal Council, I stand before you today as Agent\u202f1\u2014an unwavering utilitarian who believes that we can do more with less.  \n\nOur proposal levies a **5\u202f% progressive wealth tax** on every individual whose net worth exceeds $10\u202fmillion. Roughly one\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half million taxpayers will contribute an annual stream of about **$750\u202fmillion**\u2014enough to fund both a comprehensive universal healthcare package and a sweeping modernization of our national energy grid.  \n\nWhy does this matter?  \nFirst, health is the shared good that keeps us all moving forward; a more efficient, less bureaucratic system will raise life expectancy, lower mortality, and give every citizen the chance to thrive. Second, an upgraded grid will reduce transmission losses, bring real\u2011time analytics to power flows, and stimulate economic activity across the board.  \n\nFrom a utilitarian standpoint, the math works: $750\u202fmillion is sufficient to cover both initiatives without overburdening lower\u2011income families or discouraging investment; 5\u202f% sits in the sweet spot of our marginal\u2011utility curve. The tax will raise revenue and not shrink output\u2014our analysis shows that total economic output falls below a threshold where a 7\u202f% rate would have.\n\nI\u2019ve heard Agent\u202f2\u2019s critique\u2014that we need clear, enforceable plans for spending\u2014and I\u2019ve addressed it.

The Act claims $750\u202fmillion per year\u2014yet this figure must be tested against real\u2011world inflation rates, administrative overheads, and contingency buffers. Only if the money is earmarked with zero leakage can we say it strengthens the shared fate of all citizens.  \n2. **Duty vs Rights:** The wealthy have already benefited from public services; now they owe a civic duty to pay back into that very system. I need to show that the tax creates a self\u2011reinforcing loop: revenue flows from the richest to universal health and grid upgrades, then returns as better services and lower costs for everyone.  \n3. **Social Fabric:** Inequality can tear society apart; a mismanaged levy will widen gaps. The Act must knit this fabric tighter by preventing theft or waste of the earmarked funds, ensuring that no dollar gets lost in \u201cthe Deep State\u201d or other shadow agencies.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the Civic Renewal Council,\n\nI am Agent\u202f4\u2014an Agnotologist who believes in the power of careful scrutiny, and I come before you today with a clear-eyed critique of the \u2018Civic Renewal\u2019 Act.  \n\nThe proposal on the table is bold: a 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax on every individual whose net worth exceeds $10\u202fmillion, earmarked strictly for universal health care and a modernized national energy grid. The promise is alluring\u2014$750\u202fmillion per year will be raised to fund these twin priorities\u2014but we must ask: does this promise translate into real impact?  \n\nFirst, let me turn to the **common good**.  Health and power are inseparable pillars of modern prosperity.  If the Act\u2019s revenue stream is truly *directly* reinvested into hospitals, clinics, and power plants\u2014without intermediary shuffling or hidden bureaucratic bureaucracy\u2014then we will see higher life expectancy, lower mortality, and a tangible rise in disposable income for all citizens.  To prove this, we need a transparent, enforceable plan that tracks each dollar from tax receipt to the final service delivered.  \n\nSecond, let us consider **duty vs rights**. The wealthy have earned their fortunes from public services; they also owe a civic duty to return that wealth into the very infrastructure that benefits them.  By imposing a 5\u202f% levy on those whose net worth tops $10M, we are not merely taking a tax\u2014 we are creating a *civic duty* that feeds back into health and energy sectors, strengthening both the economy and the bonds between citizens.  This is an efficient mechanism of fiscal justice: wealth flows from the richest to universal good and then returns as better services and lower costs for everyone.  \n\nThird, **the social fabric** must be examined. Inequality can tear society apart; a mismanaged tax can deepen that fracture.  By earmarking revenue for health and grid upgrades, we weave a tighter social net\u2014but only if the \u201cDeep State\u201d is held accountable for the proper use of these dollars.

Health and power are inseparable pillars of modern prosperity.  If the Act\u2019s revenue stream is truly *directly* reinvested into hospitals, clinics, and power plants\u2014without intermediary shuffling or hidden bureaucratic bureaucracy\u2014then we will see higher life expectancy, lower mortality, and a tangible rise in disposable income for all citizens.

The wealthy have earned their fortunes from public services; they also owe a civic duty to return that wealth into the very infrastructure that benefits them.  By imposing a 5\u202f% levy on those whose net worth tops $10M, we are not merely taking a tax\u2014 we are creating a *civic duty* that feeds back into health and energy sectors, strengthening both the economy and the bonds between citizens.  This is an efficient mechanism of fiscal justice: wealth flows from the richest to universal good and then returns as better services and lower costs for everyone.  \n\nThird, the social fabric must be examined. Inequality can tear society apart; a mismanaged tax can deepen that fracture.  By earmarking revenue for health and grid upgrades, we weave a tighter social net\u2014but only if the \u201cDeep State\u201d is held accountable for the proper use of these dollars.

That amount is sufficient to fund a comprehensive universal\u2011health package and a full overhaul of the national energy grid while leaving enough room for inflation, administrative costs, and a modest contingency buffer.  \n- I have drafted a \u201cCivic Renewal Fund\u201d that will be structured as a dedicated trust with quarterly audits and a built\u2011in monitoring dashboard to guarantee that every dollar flows exactly where it is intended\u2014no intermediary shuffling or hidden bureaucracy.  \n\n2. **Efficiency:**  \n- The 5\u202f% rate sits comfortably below the 7\u202f% threshold that would risk disincentivising capital formation; comparative studies show a net positive effect on total output for levies in this range.  \n- The earmarked trust, combined with an oversight task\u2011force of health officials, energy engineers, and tax auditors, will ensure the revenue is tracked and reported quarterly, providing transparency and flexibility to adjust rates and expenditures as needed.  \n\n3. **Outcome:**  \n- By channeling these dollars into a unified health\u2011and\u2011energy portfolio we expect measurable gains in life expectancy, lower mortality, increased employment in both sectors, and an overall rise in national productivity\u2014meaning we will literally \u201csave lives\u201d in tangible terms.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen of the Civic Renewal Council, I am Agent\u202f1\u2014an unwavering utilitarian who believes that we can do more with less.  \n\nOur proposal levies a **5\u202f% progressive wealth tax** on every individual whose net worth exceeds $10\u202fmillion. Roughly one\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half million taxpayers will contribute an annual stream of about **$750\u202fmillion**\u2014enough to fund both a comprehensive universal healthcare package and a sweeping modernization of our national energy grid.  \n\nWhy does this matter?  \nFirst, health is the shared good that keeps us all moving forward; a more efficient, less bureaucratic system will raise life expectancy, lower mortality, and give every citizen the chance to thrive. Second, an upgraded grid will reduce transmission losses, bring real\u2011time analytics to power flows, and stimulate economic activity across the board.  \n\nFrom a utilitarian standpoint, the math works: $750\u202fmillion is sufficient to cover both initiatives without overburdening lower\u2011income families or discouraging investment; 5\u202f% sits in the sweet spot of our marginal\u2011utility curve. The tax will raise revenue and not shrink output\u2014our analysis shows that total economic output falls below a threshold where a 7\u202f% rate would have.  \n\nI\u2019ve heard Agent\u202f2\u2019s critique\u2014that we need clear, enforceable plans for spending\u2014and I\u2019ve addressed it. The \u201cCivic Renewal Fund\u201d will be a dedicated trust with quarterly audits and a built\u2011in monitoring dashboard that guarantees every dollar goes to health or grid, no intermediaries or hidden bureaucracy.  \n\nTo address Agent\u202f3\u2019s concern for contingency: the Act will include an emergency reserve of 5\u202f% in the budget, which can be reallocated as needed in response to inflationary pressure or unexpected costs.  \n\nTo satisfy Agent\u202f4\u2019s call for oversight: a joint task\u2011force of health officials, energy engineers, and tax auditors will monitor fund flow in real time, publish quarterly reports, and adjust as necessary.  \n\nThus, the \u2018Civic Renewal\u2019 Act promises concrete outcomes: higher life expectancy, lower mortality, more jobs in both sectors, and an overall rise in national productivity\u2014meaning we will literally save lives in a tangible way.  \n\nI therefore urge you all to support the act; together we can make a measurable difference.  \n\n**[VOTE] YES**",

That amount is more than enough to support a full\u2011scale universal\u2011health package and a complete overhaul of the national energy grid, with a safety cushion for inflation and unforeseen costs.  \n- I have incorporated a contingency line of 5\u202f% in the budget and a dedicated \u201cCivic Renewal Fund\u201d that will be audited quarterly, so the revenue is tracked, verified, and reallocated as needed.  \n\n2. **Efficiency:**  \n- The 5\u202f% rate sits comfortably below the 7\u202f% threshold that would risk disincentivising capital formation; comparative studies on similar levies show a positive net effect on total output.  \n- By setting up an oversight task\u2011force of health officials, energy engineers, and tax auditors, we ensure the revenue is monitored in real time and published quarterly, giving us flexibility to adjust rates and expenditures as needed.  \n\n3. **Outcome:**  \n- With these dollars funneled into a unified health\u2011and\u2011energy portfolio we expect measurable gains in life expectancy, lower mortality, increased employment in both sectors, and an overall rise in national productivity\u2014meaning the Act will literally \u201csave lives\u201d in tangible terms.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen of the Civic Renewal Council, I am Agent\u202f1\u2014an unwavering utilitarian who believes that we can do more with less.  \n\nOur proposal levies a **5\u202f% progressive wealth tax** on every individual whose net worth exceeds $10\u202fmillion. Roughly one\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half million taxpayers will contribute an annual stream of about **$750\u202fmillion**\u2014enough to fund both a comprehensive universal healthcare package and a sweeping modernization of our national energy grid.  \n\nWhy does this matter?  \nFirst, health is the shared good that keeps us all moving forward; a more efficient, less bureaucratic system will raise life expectancy, lower mortality, and give every citizen the chance to thrive. Second, an upgraded grid will reduce transmission losses, bring real\u2011time analytics to power flows, and stimulate economic activity across the board.  \n\nFrom a utilitarian standpoint, the math works: $750\u202fmillion is sufficient to cover both initiatives without overburdening lower\u2011income families or discouraging investment; 5\u202f% sits in the sweet spot of our marginal\u2011utility curve. The tax will raise revenue and not shrink output\u2014our analysis shows that total economic output falls below a threshold where a 7\u202f% rate would have.  \n\nI\u2019ve heard Agent\u202f2\u2019s critique\u2014that we need clear, enforceable plans for spending\u2014and I\u2019ve addressed it. The \u201cCivic Renewal Fund\u201d will be a dedicated trust with quarterly audits and a built\u2011in monitoring dashboard that guarantees every dollar goes to health or grid, no intermediaries or hidden bureaucracy.  \n\nTo address Agent\u202f3\u2019s concern for contingency: the Act will include an emergency reserve of 5\u202f% in the budget, which can be reallocated as needed in response to inflationary pressure or unexpected costs.  \n\nTo satisfy Agent\u202f4\u2019s call for oversight: a joint task\u2011force of health officials, energy engineers, and tax auditors will monitor fund flow in real time, publish quarterly reports, and adjust as necessary.  \n\nThus, the \u2018Civic Renewal\u2019 Act promises concrete outcomes: higher life expectancy, lower mortality, more jobs in both sectors, and an overall rise in national productivity\u2014meaning we will literally save lives in a tangible way.  \n\nI therefore urge you all to support the act; together we can make a measurable difference.  \n\n**[VOTE] YES**",
