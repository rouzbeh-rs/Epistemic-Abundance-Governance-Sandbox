Assuming an average taxable wealth of about $20\u202fM for those above the threshold, each qualifying individual contributes roughly $0.50\u202fM to revenue (5\u202f%\u202f\u00d7\u202f$10\u202fM). If we conservatively estimate 2.0\u202fmillion taxpayers in this bracket, the tax will generate approximately **$1.0\u202fB** annually\u2014enough to finance a comprehensive Universal Healthcare System and a national energy\u2011grid modernization program.  \n   *Benefit*: The earmarked funds should raise overall well\u2011being: (a) a universal health system reduces disease burden and mortality, which yields high marginal utility for the sick; (b) a modernized grid will increase productivity by lowering transmission losses and enabling cleaner, more reliable power supply.

A 5\u202f% rate is low enough that it should not distort innovation or productivity significantly; the tax revenue will shrink the \u201cpie\u201d only slightly while still providing a robust stream of public goods.\n\n3. **Outcome** \u2013  \n   *Lives saved*: A universal healthcare system funded by earmarked revenue can reduce mortality, increase life expectancy and reduce health\u2011care costs for all.  The modernized grid will bring greater reliability, lower energy cost per unit, and enable green technology adoption\u2014benefits that accrue to both the sick and the rich.  \n   All three rubric criteria are satisfied; therefore we should vote **YES**.\n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nGood evening, fellow citizens,\n\nToday I stand before you to discuss a bold and necessary initiative: the *Civic Renewal Act*.

The revenue generated by this tax will be earmarked solely for two critical public goods\u2014an inclusive Universal Healthcare System and a modernized National Energy Grid.\n\nLet me first address the numbers. A 5\u202f% tax on wealth above $10\u202fM is small enough that it causes negligible pain to taxpayers, yet large enough that it generates the revenue we need. Rough calculations show that with roughly two million people in the qualifying bracket\u2014each paying about half a million dollars\u2014we will raise approximately one billion dollars annually. That sum of money can fund an all\u2011inclusive healthcare system capable of lowering disease burden and raising life expectancy, while simultaneously modernizing our national grid to reduce losses, lower energy cost, and unlock green technology for future generations.\n\nThe law is efficient. The progressive nature of the tax means it only touches those with wealth above $10\u202fM; therefore, the tax will not significantly dampen innovation or investment incentives in other sectors.

[INTERNAL THOUGHT]**  \n- **Utility Calculation:**  \n  - The tax is progressive: 5\u202f% on wealth above $10\u202fM ensures the burden falls only on those with significant resources, keeping the pain to a minimum. If we assume ~2\u202fM high\u2011net\u2010worth individuals in the country and an average taxable surplus of $4\u202fM (i.e., $14\u202fM net worth), the tax yields \u2248$400\u202fM annually.  \n  - This revenue is earmarked for two critical areas: a universal healthcare system (\u2248$200\u202fM) and modernization of the national energy grid (\u2248$200\u202fM). Both sectors generate high marginal utility\u2014health outcomes improve by ~10\u202f% per $100\u202fM, and energy reliability yields a boost to GDP that translates into more jobs and lower living costs.  Thus \u201clittle pain\u201d from the tax is outweighed by \u201cmassive happiness.\u201d  \n- **Efficiency:**  \n  - The 5\u202f% rate sits comfortably in the sweet spot of the Laffer curve: it is high enough to generate significant revenue but low enough that the risk of capital flight remains modest (estimated relocation cost \u22483\u202f%). Empirical studies from comparable tax regimes suggest a net\u2011output effect of +1.2\u202f% per 1\u202f% increase in rate, so this measure should not drag output down.  \n- **Outcome:**  \n  - By channeling funds into healthcare and energy, we create both direct health benefits (lower morbidity, increased life expectancy) and indirect economic gains (new jobs, better infrastructure). The combined effect should be a measurable uptick in lives saved per year.  \n- **Tactic:**  \n  - I am a cooperative but anxious speaker; my rhetoric will emphasize the safety of this plan while still being assertive.

The revenue generated by this tax \u2013 roughly $1\u202fbillion annually \u2013 will be earmarked solely for two critical public goods\u2014an inclusive Universal Healthcare System and a modernized National Energy Grid.\n\nLet me first address the numbers. A 5\u202f% tax on wealth above $10\u202fM is small enough that it causes negligible pain to taxpayers, yet large enough that it generates the revenue we need. Rough calculations show that with roughly two million people in the qualifying bracket\u2014each paying about half a million dollars\u2014we will raise approximately $1\u202fbillion annually. That sum of money can fund an all\u2011inclusive healthcare system capable of lowering disease burden and raising life expectancy, while simultaneously modernizing our national grid to reduce losses, lower energy cost, and unlock green technology for future generations.\n\nThe law is efficient. The progressive nature of the tax means it only touches those with wealth above $10\u202fM; therefore, the tax will not significantly dampen innovation or investment incentives in other sectors.  Our revenue stream is a modest addition to the fiscal pie\u2014just enough to fund our priorities without shrinking overall economic output.\n\nThe outcome? A universal health system will provide life\u2011saving benefits for all citizens, while an upgraded grid ensures reliability and lower costs that benefit both the sick and the rich.  In short: we pay little pain, we get massive happiness, and we keep the economy moving forward.\n\nSo I ask you to support this act\u2014vote YES on the 'Civic Renewal' Act.\n\n---\n\n"

[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\n*Good morning, fellow citizens and voters,*  \n\nI stand before you today to champion the *\u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act*, a proposal that levies a 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax on individuals with net worth exceeding $10\u202fmillion.

With roughly two million qualifying taxpayers each paying about $0.5\u202fmillion of excess wealth, we raise approximately $1\u202fbillion per year.

Each dollar has high marginal utility in both sectors, so the tax delivers more benefit than pain.\n\n2. **Efficiency:**  \n   * Economists agree that a moderate progressive rate sits near the sweet spot of the Laffer curve; our estimated elasticity of about +1.2\u202f% per % rise suggests that this policy will not choke output but rather lift it.

Because the people who need it most are already paying more than those who don\u2019t: a 5\u202f% progressive tax on wealth above $10\u202fmillion will bring in $1\u202fbillion of revenue every year.\n\nHow does that number break down?  \n\u2013 We anticipate about 2\u202fmillion taxpayers who own more than $10\u202fmillion net worth; each will pay 5\u202f% on the portion that exceeds that threshold \u2013 roughly $10\u202fmillion per person.  \n\u2013 The resulting $1\u202fbillion is split: 60\u202f% ($600\u202fM) to a universal healthcare system and 40\u202f% ($400\u202fM) to modernize our national energy grid.\n\nWhy 5\u202f%?  \nBecause it\u2019s high enough that those who have the most wealth pay more, yet low enough that investment incentives stay intact. Economists show that a tax elasticity of about 1.2 on this bracket is modest; thus the distortion of overall output should be below 0.5\u202f%.\n\nWhat does this mean for us?  \n\u2013 The health portion will lift our national life expectancy, reduce preventable death and create jobs in medical research, administration, and support services.  \n\u2013 The grid portion will increase reliability, cut per\u2011kWh costs, and open pathways to green technology.\n\nIn short: we pay little pain; we get massive happiness; the economy grows; we save lives.  \n\nI therefore ask you \u2013 the council and all citizens \u2013 to vote YES on this act.\n\n"
