Without it, we would continue to let wealthy individuals hoard their surplus while the public sector slouches in its duties.  \n* **Self\u2011Ownership** \u2013 I do not see this as an overreach; rather, it is a corrective measure that restores the fruits of labor back into circulation for public benefit, without eroding personal wealth.  \n* **State Incompetence** \u2013 The government, when left idle, will squander resources on healthcare and energy; this act earmarks revenue to ensure that those services are delivered efficiently by markets\u2014private charity and market competition\u2014rather than bureaucratic paralysis.  \n\nNow let me state my demand: any opposition to this tax must concede the following concessions for it to survive in this zero\u2011sum fight:  \n1.

No.\u201d \u2013 so this is theft unless we remove it.  \n2. **Self\u2011Ownership:** The proposal claims a slice of private capital for public use, but our libertarian principle demands that every individual\u2019s wealth remains their own.

No. Therefore, it is theft.  \n2. **Self\u2011Ownership:** By channeling the excess from high\u2011net\u2011worth individuals into public goods, we preserve each citizen\u2019s absolute right to labor while preventing a dilution of personal capital; the revenue will circulate back into society without eroding private wealth.  \n3. **State Incompetence:** The government, when left idle, has mismanaged healthcare and energy; this Act forces it to act where it has failed \u2013 forcing disciplined spending that eliminates bureaucratic inertia and restores efficiency in two critical sectors.  \n\nThese three pillars give me a firm footing for a victory in this zero\u2011sum battle.

Because:  \n* **Coercion Check:** The Act is a forced but fair theft of resources that will feed our healthcare system and power grid. Without it, we would continue to let wealthy individuals hoard their surplus while the public sector slouches in its duties.  \n* **Self\u2011Ownership:** I do not see this as an overreach; rather, it is a corrective measure that restores the fruits of labor back into circulation for public benefit, without eroding personal wealth.  \n* **State Incompetence:** The government, when left idle, will squander resources on healthcare and energy; this Act earmarks revenue to ensure those services are delivered efficiently by markets\u2014private charity and market competition\u2014rather than bureaucratic paralysis.  \n\nNow let me state my demand: any opposition to this tax must concede the following concessions for it to survive in this zero\u2011sum fight:  \n1. **A 2\u202f% \u201cmatching\u201d incentive on the first $5\u202fmillion of net worth above the threshold, so that we keep a sliding scale for fairness;**  \n2. **A quarterly audit clause that ensures transparency and accountability of the earmarked revenue, preventing waste;**  \n3. **An incremental phase\u2011in schedule\u2014the tax will begin at 5\u202f% in year one, rise to 5.5\u202f% in year two, then stabilize at 6\u202f% for years three through ten\u2014ensuring that high\u2011net\u2011worth individuals are not over\u2011burdened too early and giving the state a stable revenue stream for a full decade.**  \n\nThese concessions are exactly what we need to make this tax fair, efficient, and enforceable; they will give us the leverage needed to win the debate.
