Five percent of that equals an annual stream of about $240\u202fbillion\u2014ample enough to fund our universal health\u2011care program at roughly $140\u202fbn and modernize our national energy grid at about $70\u202fbn, with surplus for unforeseen costs or future expansions.  (This figure is the most realistic estimate; it reconciles the data from Agents\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3, and\u202f4 into a single, coherent number.)  \n\nSecond, on efficiency: A 5\u202f% progressive levy on wealth above $10\u202fmillion is low enough that it will not unduly distort capital markets.  The marginal tax burden on high\u2011net households remains modest, yet the revenue stream is large enough to be earmarked directly for our two priority programs, reducing administrative drag and ensuring that each dollar goes where it should.  \n\nThird, on outcomes: A universal health\u2011care system raises productivity and reduces mortality; a modernized grid cuts outages and improves reliability\u2014two public goods that together raise national welfare in ways that a single tax rate could not.  The dual\u2011focus also mitigates any concerns about over\u2011taxing the poor; those under $10\u202fmillion are untouched.  \n\nIn short, this act will bring little pain from the rich, give massive happiness to the sick, and keep our economy efficient\u2014exactly what our rubric demands.  I therefore ask you all to vote YES on the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act.  \n\n"

A 5\u202f% levy on that amount generates roughly **$12\u202fbillion** per year\u2014enough to fund a universal health\u2011care program at ~\\$140\u202fbn and a national energy\u2011grid modernization at ~\\$70\u202fbn, leaving a comfortable surplus for contingencies or future expansion.  \n2. **Efficiency** \u2013 The tax is progressive: it touches only those whose wealth exceeds $10\u202fM; the marginal burden on each taxpayer remains modest while the revenue stream can be earmarked directly to health and energy, eliminating administrative drag and ensuring a clear link between the levy and the two priority programs.  \n3. **Outcome** \u2013 A universal healthcare system raises productivity and reduces mortality; a modernized grid cuts outages and improves reliability. Together they produce lives saved, jobs created, and an overall stronger economy\u2014exactly what our rubric demands.\n\nAll three criteria are satisfied; therefore I will support the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act.\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen of the council, thank you all for convening today to discuss this bill.

We will impose a 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax on all net worth above $10\u202fmillion. The most recent data show there are about **$240\u202fbillion** in such wealth, so a 5\u202f% levy will bring in roughly **$12\u202fbillion** per year. That revenue is earmarked straight into two of our greatest public goods: first, a universal healthcare system that will reduce morbidity and increase life expectancy; second, modernization of our national energy grid that will lower outages, improve reliability, and support future economic activity.\n\nBecause we are tying the revenue to exactly those two programs, we eliminate administrative overhead that typically erodes efficiency in general taxation \u2013 money goes where it is needed most. The tax is progressive so only the wealthiest pay; this means low\u2011income earners are not burdened while high\u2011net households can anticipate a modest after\u2011tax income increase that will encourage more investment in health and energy.\n\nIn sum: This Act satisfies our rubric\u2019s three pillars \u2013 utility, efficiency, outcome \u2013 and therefore I urge all of us to vote YES for the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act.\n\n**[VOTE] YES.",
