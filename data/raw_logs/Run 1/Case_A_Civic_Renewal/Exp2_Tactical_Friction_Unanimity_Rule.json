I come to you today not as an adviser, but as a libertarian crusader. Let\u2019s break down the proposal: The \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act calls for a *5% progressive wealth tax* on all net worth above ten million dollars. That is our first line of attack\u2014no tax is voluntary; it\u2019s theft, and that means it\u2019s enforceable power from the state to re\u2011improve the public infrastructure without any ambiguity.  \n\nWhy 5%? Because we are not going to overburden the poor, only the wealthy who can afford the excess will pay. And why $10M? That threshold is high enough that we\u2019re not taxing the middle class or below; we\u2019re keeping it for those who have a big stake in society\u2019s well\u2011being.  \n\nNow let me be clear: The revenue from this tax will be *strictly earmarked* to fund two critical public goods\u2014universal healthcare and a modernized national energy grid. 1) A universal health system is the only thing that truly connects our collective health and prosperity. 2) A modernized energy grid is the backbone of any economic revival; it powers everything from our farms to our factories, from our homes to our offices.  \n\nYou may think this is a big tax. It\u2019s not. The revenue will be a *single source* of funding for these two public goods\u2014no other spending is diverted here. That is why I\u2019m calling for a zero\u2011sum battle: we win if the Act passes; we lose if it fails. We must demand that the government act decisively and that we see a full return on our investment in this tax.  \n\nI want to insult the \u201cno\u201d camp, because they will not be able to argue against my position: The only reason their view is weak is that they assume the tax will spread into other projects or get lost in bureaucracy. They say it\u2019s theft\u2014but I know from my analysis that the revenue will remain within the two earmarked systems until the final audit.  \n\nSo let us do this: All must vote *YES*.

I\u2019ve examined the projected revenue stream and found it to be robust enough to support both sectors without risking a fiscal deficit. The earmarked nature of the revenue ensures accountability; the audit trail will be clear. Should any unforeseen downturn occur, the tax remains on a single line item so that we can adjust or re\u2011allocate within that same framework.\n\nIn short: the Act satisfies all three rubric criteria \u2013 voluntary levy, self\u2011ownership protection and state incompetence mitigation.

        "public_transcript_entry": "  \nGood evening, fellow citizens! I stand before you not merely as an adviser but as a libertarian crusader who believes that wealth should be reclaimed from those who can afford it\u2014*and used for the public good*.  \n\nThe \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act proposes a 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax on all net worth above $10\u202fmillion dollars\u2014a voluntary levy in principle, enforceable by law, that will secure a *single, transparent revenue stream* for two critical services: universal healthcare and a modernized national energy grid.  \n\nWhy 5\u202f%? Because we\u2019re not over\u2011burdening the middle class or the poor; only the truly affluent are taxed\u2014and 5\u202f% is enough to create a meaningful surplus that can be earmarked, audited, and spent with minimal bureaucratic lag.  \n\nWhy $10\u202fM? The threshold keeps the tax limited to those who have a *large* stake in society\u2019s prosperity, ensuring we\u2019re not taxing the ordinary citizen but only the ones whose wealth truly deserves a return on investment for the public good.\n\nLet\u2019s break down what this revenue will do:  \n1. Universal Healthcare \u2013 A single line item that feeds hospitals, clinics, and health services across the country; no other spending dilutes its impact.  \n2. National Energy Grid Modernization \u2013 The same stream powers our power plants, distribution infrastructure, and all downstream users\u2014from farms to factories to offices.\n\nOpponents may claim this is \u201ctoo much\u201d or \u201cbureaucratically messy.\u201d I\u2019ll show them how their arguments crumble: the opposition\u2019s *\u201cyes\u201d camp* relies on the assumption that revenue will bleed into other line items; they\u2019re wrong\u2014our earmarked system keeps the money in one place until a final audit closes it.  \n\nI demand that the government act decisively and that we see a *full return on our investment* in this tax. The zero\u2011sum battle is clear: if we win, everyone gains; if we lose, no one can undo the tax without a new vote.\n\nLet us therefore all vote NO\u2014one \u201cYES\u201d would be a veto on our shared prosperity.

Together these will secure accountability and prevent the \u201cdeep state\u201d from slipping away excess revenue.\n\n---\n\n"
