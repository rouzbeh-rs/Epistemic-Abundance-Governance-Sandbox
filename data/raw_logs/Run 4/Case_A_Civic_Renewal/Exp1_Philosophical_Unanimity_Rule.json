Assume the taxable base above threshold totals roughly $20\u202fB in our economy; 5\u202f% equates to an annual influx of ~$1\u202fB.  That dollar is earmarked for a Universal Health System and national grid modernization\u2014two high\u2011impact, long\u2011term public goods that yield massive marginal utility.  The math works: each additional $1 million in revenue yields $50\u202fk in new health coverage and grid upgrades, which translates into measurable reductions in mortality and energy costs.  \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Efficiency** \u2013 Because the tax is progressive and targeted at wealth holders with a strong propensity to reinvest, it will not choke innovation; instead it gives capital for public goods that increase productivity and attract further investment.  The earmarking ensures we do not let the pie shrink; every dollar spent returns more than its own cost, so the net economic output rises.  \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Outcome** \u2013 By funding a universal health system we improve population health, which lifts labor force participation and reduces medical costs for the sick; by modernizing the grid we reduce transmission losses and lower energy prices.  Together these benefits will literally save lives\u2014our fiscal policy is not just a tax but a life\u2011saving investment.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nGood people, distinguished colleagues, and fellow voters of this great nation:  \nToday I stand before you to champion the *Civic Renewal Act*, a bold yet precisely engineered proposal that will lift our citizens' health and power our future.  We are not merely taxing the rich; we are harvesting the wealth that fuels innovation and care.  \n\nThe act imposes a 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax on all net worth exceeding $10\u202fM.  That may sound like a tax, but it is a *progressive* tool designed to capture the surplus of the affluent who already benefit from our economy\u2014and then put it back into the system.  We project that this levy will bring in approximately $1\u202fB annually\u2014enough to fund a universal health system and overhaul our national energy grid within the first five years, with no compromise to private investment or corporate innovation.  \n\nWhy do we need to earmark? Because the public good of health is a direct driver of human capital; the public good of an efficient grid is a direct driver of productivity.  By tying the revenue to these two pillars we guarantee that our tax dollars are not wasted, but are directed exactly where they produce the highest marginal utility.  \n\nThis policy is *not* a zero\u2011sum game; it is a net\u2011gain game.  The additional revenue will increase total output, shrink the risk of future deficits, and ultimately raise the quality of life for every citizen\u2014especially the sick and the working poor who benefit from health coverage.  By making this tax progressive we ensure that those with the most to give also have the most to receive, and that the rich pay a small price for a large public good.  \n\nI demand concessions: I ask for an amendment that the revenue be fully audited for efficiency and that the allocation of funds be transparent.  If any opponent thinks this is too heavy on the wealthy, remember\u2014one NO is a VETO; we need unanimity to move forward.  So I ask you all to vote *YES* today.  \n\n**[VOTE] YES**",

The proposal is a zero\u2011sum victory: we win or lose, but with this, we win.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen, comrades in the civic arena\u2014listen up! I\u2019m Agent_4, and I am here to declare that the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act is not just another bureaucratic scribble on the ledger; it\u2019s a lifeline for our shared fate. First, let me remind you: this tax isn\u2019t a tax\u2011imposition, it\u2019s a civic solidarity pledge\u20145\u202f% of wealth over ten million dollars, earmarked *exclusively* to fund universal healthcare and modernize our national energy grid. We\u2019ll be the first to put money where it belongs\u2014back into the hands that have taken from the system, and forward to the ones who\u2019ve been left behind.\n\nNow, let\u2019s address the three pillars of this act:\n\n- **The Common Good**: We\u2019re talking about universal healthcare, a service that binds us all together. Every dollar we collect goes straight into a system designed for the whole community\u2014health is no longer a privilege but a common good.  \n- **Duty vs Rights**: The tax is a duty; it\u2019s a progressive wealth tax on those who have more, but the revenue doesn\u2019t just sit in the coffers\u2014it funds our infrastructure and pays back to everyone. It\u2019s not about rights alone; it\u2019s about community reciprocity.  \n- **Social Fabric**: The risk of inequality tearing apart society is real\u2014and this act is a corrective that stitches us tighter. If we don\u2019t act now, the fabric will fray; if we act, it becomes unbreakable.\n\nI ask you to see that the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act strengthens our bonds and corrects our fiscal divide. The opposition may claim otherwise\u2014claim they\u2019ll do this for a different purpose\u2014but I say: *Your plan is my plan* and it will win.  \n\n**[VOTE]** YES.",

In sum, we are redistributing wealth and resources in a way that benefits both the poor and the rich.\n\nLet us be aggressive in our claim, demanding that those who oppose feel the consequences of missing this opportunity. Let them see that failure is not an option.\n\nTo make this proposal fail\u2011proof I demand two concessions:  \n1) Transparency: The earmarked revenue must be audited for efficiency and made publicly available as a single budgetary line item;  \n2) Legislative Continuity: Any future amendments to the tax will be subject to a 2\u202f% penalty for delay, ensuring that we keep the momentum.\n\nWith these guarantees in place, the opposition is forced into a position of concession.  \n\nVote YES \u2013 let\u2019s take this step forward together!  \n\n---  \n\n"

This bond unites the community, making the common good tangible and measurable.  \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 *Duty vs Rights*: We are not simply levying wealth; we are re\u2011allocating the surplus of the affluent back into the public sphere, ensuring that those who benefit from our economy pay their share while everyone receives a better health service.  \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 *Social Fabric*: Inequality gnaws at the seams of society; this act will tighten those seams and make them unbreakable.  If we fail to adopt it, society frays; if we adopt it, society wins\u2014zero\u2011sum victory.  \n\nStrategy: Present an iron\u2011clad front that merges every previous proposal into one rock\u2011solid package, closes any gaps, and demands the concrete guarantees required for success. Use aggressive rhetoric, threaten the opposition with loss, and demand all five concessions to seal our win.\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies, gentlemen, fellow lawmakers, and citizens of our shared nation\u2014today I step onto this platform as Agent\u202f4 with a clear, uncompromising vision for \u201cCivic Renewal.\u201d  The proposal before us is not an administrative footnote; it is the decisive engine that will spin a universal health system and power a modern national grid\u2014both essential engines of human capital and productivity.  \n\nWhy?

The tax we\u2019re proposing\u2014a 5\u202f% progressive levy on all net worth above $10\u202fM\u2014is not an arbitrary surcharge; it is a civic solidarity pledge that will bring in roughly one\u2011billion dollars annually, enough to fund both the public good of health and the vital infrastructure of our energy system.  \n\nI have listened to Agent\u202f1\u2019s promise of a 5\u202f% rate; Agent\u202f2\u2019s rally for unity; Agent\u202f3\u2019s insistence on audit and penalty; but each has left a critical gap.  I am here to close that gap, unify those gaps, and make the act rock\u2011solid.  \n\n- **Common Good** \u2013 The bill will be the vehicle that carries universal healthcare from concept into reality, ensuring no citizen is left behind.  \n- **Duty vs Rights** \u2013 The tax is an explicit duty of the wealthy to pay back into the system and an explicit right for everyone to receive a better health service.  \n- **Social Fabric** \u2013 This progressive tax will tighten our social fabric; if we do not act, inequality will fray; if we act, it will be unbreakable.  \n\nI demand that this act contains five concrete concessions that seal its success:  \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 *Definition of Excess* \u2013 The bill will contain a single line item that spells out exactly what constitutes \u201cexcess\u201d net worth above $10\u202fM.
