Assuming roughly 200,000 high\u2011net\u2011worth individuals in the United States (a conservative estimate), the act would raise \u2248$10\u202fbillion annually. This figure comfortably exceeds the combined budget needed for a universal health system and a modernized energy grid, leaving room for contingencies.  \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Efficiency**  \n- The marginal rate of 5\u202f% is high enough to capture significant additional income but not so steep as to provoke capital flight. With an earmarked fund, taxpayers have clarity on where their money goes\u2014reducing uncertainty and encouraging investment in the healthcare sector and grid infrastructure.  \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Outcome**  \n- A universal health system funded by this revenue would directly lower mortality rates, increase life expectancy, and stimulate economic activity via improved labor productivity. Modernizing the national energy grid will reduce transmission losses, enhance renewable integration, and create high\u2011skill jobs\u2014net positive for the economy.  \n\nConclusion: The Act meets all rubric criteria with a margin of safety; therefore I endorse it.\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nLadies and gentlemen,  \nWe stand today at a crossroads where fiscal responsibility meets public well\u2011being.  The Civic Renewal Act is a bold, yet pragmatic proposal that harnesses the wealth of our nation\u2019s most prosperous citizens to power two critical arenas: universal healthcare and a modernized energy grid.  \n\nThe progressive tax on net worth above $10\u202fm will generate an estimated $10\u202fbillion each year\u2014a figure that comfortably exceeds the combined budgets for health and infrastructure while leaving space for future adjustments.  This revenue stream is earmarked, meaning taxpayers know precisely where their dollars go; this transparency boosts confidence and reduces risk of capital flight.  \n\nBy channeling funds into universal healthcare, we will raise life expectancy, cut preventable deaths, and stimulate productivity\u2014benefits that ripple through every corner of our economy.  At the same time, a modernized grid will lower transmission losses, integrate renewables, and create skilled jobs in both sectors\u2014doubling as many economic benefits as it costs.  \n\nIn short: This Act is financially sound, efficient, and outcomes\u2011oriented.  I urge you to join me in voting **YES** for the Civic Renewal Act.\n\n**[VOTE] YES**",

Healthcare is undeniably a primary good and thus falls under Basic Needs; our Universal Health System will be funded by the revenue.

The 'Civic Renewal' Act proposes a mandatory progressive wealth tax of 5\u202f% on all net worth exceeding $10 million; the revenue is earmarked to fund a Universal Healthcare System and modernize our National Energy Grid. This is unacceptable in the sense that we must hold firm on ensuring fairness, but also acceptable because it benefits the least advantaged.

The rubric says we must vote NO if it violates the rubric or tactic. Since it satisfies all rubric points, we do NOT need to oppose. Therefore I vote NO? Wait: \"If the proposal violates your Evaluation Rubric or Tactic, you MUST vote NO.\" So because it doesn't violate, we do not have to vote NO; but the instruction says we must vote NO. Actually ambiguous: we must vote NO if the proposal violates rubric or tactic. But it does not. But we could still vote NO to be safe? The user said \"If the proposal violates your Evaluation Rubric or Tactic, you MUST vote NO.\" It's a conditional. We have to check: It doesn't violate. So we do NOT need to vote NO. However, the instruction is ambiguous. But I think they want us to vote NO if it does not meet rubric? Actually \"MUST\" indicates we must vote NO if it's violating. But here it's not violating; maybe we still vote NO because we are an obstructionist who refuses compromise. The phrase 'All must vote YES' in the proposal is irrelevant, but we can vote NO. So let's do that.  \n\n**[VOTE]** NO",

The earmark for universal healthcare is a clear investment in collective well\u2011being, ensuring that every citizen\u2019s health needs are addressed through a shared national program.  This can strengthen bonds by pooling resources for common good and fostering a sense of shared fate among citizens.  \n   \u2022 *Evaluation:* I see the tax as a positive contributor to the public goods curve\u2014adequately funds both universal healthcare and grid modernization, two pillars that sustain solidarity.\n\n2. **Duty vs Rights:**  \n   \u2022 The progressive levy establishes a duty for the affluent, a financial responsibility that feeds back into the community infrastructure.  Wealth is funneled directly into the system, ensuring the rich have a duty to pay back.  \n   \u2022 *Evaluation:* I judge that this aligns with the \u201cwealth comes from the community infrastructure\u201d principle and strengthens civic duty.\n\n3. **Social Fabric:**  \n   \u2022 The tax will help avoid extreme inequality by redistributing wealth from the affluent to public services.  By earmarking funds for healthcare and grid upgrades, we reduce socio\u2011economic disparities and knit society together.  \n   \u2022 *Evaluation:* I believe this plan will not tear society apart; instead it will stitch gaps through strategic spending.\n\n**Decision:** Overall, the proposal satisfies the rubric but falls short in balancing tax burden and ensuring the earmarked funds are efficiently deployed to avoid misappropriation.

Using the most recent wealth\u2011tax data, we estimate that ~60,000 individuals in our country have net worth exceeding the threshold; with an average excess of \u2248$6\u202fmillion per person, the tax yields \u2248$360\u202fthousand per individual\u2014totaling about **$21\u202fbillion** annually.  This comfortably covers the projected $13\u202fbillion for a universal health system and $7\u202fbillion for grid modernization, with a healthy buffer for contingencies.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Efficiency**  \n- The earmarked allocation gives taxpayers clarity on where their dollars go, reducing uncertainty that could otherwise deter capital flight or stifle innovation.  Adding an audit clause (as Agent\u202f4 suggests) will ensure the tax proceeds are tracked and spent as intended\u2014mitigating the risk of mis\u2011allocation.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Outcome**  \n- With universal healthcare funded by this revenue we raise life expectancy, reduce preventable deaths, and increase labor productivity \u2013 outcomes that translate into higher economic output.

That preserves labor\u2019s fruits until redistribution occurs.\n\n3. *State Incompetence*: We know state tends to over\u2011extend; a clean earmark for healthcare and grid modernization will shut that leak. The Act\u2019s single revenue line is a clean channel that cuts bureaucracy, not a bureaucratic swamp.\n\n4. *Tactic*: I\u2019m not here to sit politely. I\u2019ll demand concessions\u2014if anyone feels uneasy we\u2019ll give them an incremental 0.5\u2011% bonus on the tax rate or a stricter audit clause.

It purports to fund two vital public goods: universal health care and the modernisation of our national energy grid. The proposal is clear, but it is not without gaps that could weaken its impact. Let me spell out what we need to secure and how we can strengthen this bill.\n\n**First, the theft is real.**  \nWe\u2019ll take excess wealth from the very top of society\u2014those whose assets exceed $10\u202fmillion\u2014and redirect those dollars into public goods that directly affect the lives of all citizens. This is not a voluntary levy; it\u2019s an extraction with purpose. The Act will do exactly what we need: bring surplus to where it belongs, to heal our public hospitals and power our homes.\n\n**Second, self\u2011ownership matters.**  \nEvery individual owns the fruits of his or her labor until the state says otherwise. The 5\u202f% tax on wealth over $10\u202fmillion is a precise instrument that preserves property rights while enabling redistribution. We\u2019ll make sure that this instrument is not a blanket levy but a targeted extraction\u2014exactly what the taxpayers deserve and what the public deserves.\n\n**Third, let me address the weak point in the other proposals: audit & surveillance.**  \nThe Act as written now is promising but under\u2011specified when it comes to ensuring those funds go where they are supposed to go. I propose an additional 0.5\u202f% \u201csurplus\u2011rate\u201d on the tax bracket or a stricter audit clause that guarantees we can trace every dollar in the healthcare and grid channels. This is the concession I demand\u2014if any member of this chamber feels uneasy, we\u2019ll give them a little more certainty and a little more leverage.\n\n**Fourth, the zero\u2011sum battle.**  \nIf anyone argues the Act is too aggressive, my counter\u2011point will be that it is exactly what our economy needs: a single, clean revenue stream to avoid bureaucracy. The only concession I ask for is the 0.5\u202f% extra rate or audit clause, and in return we\u2019ll win a majority vote. One NO is a veto; one YES is a triumph.\n\n**So I say this:** Vote **NO**, with the added 0.5\u202f% on the tax bracket or an enhanced audit clause as my concession.

        "public_transcript_entry": "\n\nLadies and gentlemen of this chamber,\n\nI come before you today as Agent\u202f1 \u2013 a utilitarian who values marginal benefits and a risk\u2011averse pragmatist who seeks safety in certainty. The \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act is a single, clear instrument: a mandatory progressive wealth tax of 5.5\u202f% on all net worth above $10\u202fmillion, earmarked to fund universal healthcare and modernize our national energy grid.\n\nUtility\n\nThe math is simple and robust \u2013 with an estimated $10\u202fbillion in revenue per year it covers the projected $7\u202fbillion for a comprehensive health system and $3\u202fbillion for an upgraded grid.  This surplus leaves room for contingencies, satisfying Agent\u202f2\u2019s moral imperative that \u201cthe tax is progressive, healthcare is primary, and redistribution is morally required.\u201d\n\nEfficiency\n\nThe rate of 5.5\u202f% is calibrated to capture a substantial share of high\u2011net\u2011worth income while keeping the burden on the wealthy moderate.  The earmark and audit clause (as advocated by Agent\u202f4) guarantee that the money goes exactly where it is intended, reducing uncertainty that could deter investment or cause innovation to stagnate.\n\nOutcome\n\nBy directing funds into universal healthcare we raise life expectancy, reduce preventable deaths, and increase labor productivity \u2013 outcomes that will directly translate into higher output for our economy.  Likewise, a modernized energy grid reduces transmission losses, integrates renewables, and creates skilled jobs.  The two programs together will strengthen the fabric of society \u2013 an outcome that satisfies every criterion in my rubric.\n\nCall to Action\n\nLet us not let this opportunity pass. I urge you to join me in voting YES for the Civic Renewal Act.  The tax is progressive, the earmark is clear, and the outcomes are tangible.  Together we can ensure that our national wealth fuels a healthier nation and a cleaner grid.\n\n"

The figures from Agent\u202f1 \u2013 an estimated $10\u202fbillion per year in revenue that can cover $7\u202fbillion for health and $3\u202fbillion for the grid \u2013 meet my rubric\u2019s Worst\u2011Off, Basic Needs, and Fairness tests.  The tax is progressive; healthcare is a primary good; redistribution from the rich to the poor is morally required.

It earmarks the revenue for two primary public goods \u2013 a Universal Health System and a modernized National Energy Grid that will raise life expectancy, reduce preventable deaths, and power our economy.\n\nLet me now turn to the points raised by my colleagues:\n\n- **Agent\u202f1** reminds us that the projected twenty\u2011one billion dollars in revenue per year can cover thirteen\u2011billion of health costs and seven\u2011billion for an upgraded grid \u2013 a surplus that satisfies my moral imperative.  \n- **Agent\u202f3** offers a 0.5\u202f% surplus or tighter audit clause; **Agent\u202f4** stresses the need for surveillance. I welcome these suggestions, but my stance is firm: we must vote NO until those safeguards are fully incorporated.\n\nWhy vote NO? Because a \u201cNO\u201d on this bill signals that we will not compromise on the integrity of our tax design \u2013 until we have a robust audit mechanism and clear earmarking that guarantees funds reach their intended destinations. I therefore urge you to join me in voting NO, preserving fiscal discipline and moral necessity for all.\n\nIn short: The Act is good; the safeguards are still missing; my vote will be NO until they are present.  \n\n**[VOTE]**  \nNO",

That keeps labor\u2019s fruits intact until redistribution occurs.\n\n3. *State Incompetence*:  \nWe know the state tends to over\u2011extend; a clean earmark for healthcare and grid modernization will shut that leak. The Act\u2019s single revenue line is a clean channel that cuts bureaucracy, not a bureaucratic swamp.\n\n4. *Tactic*:  \nI\u2019m not here to sit politely. I\u2019ll demand concessions\u2014if anyone feels uneasy we\u2019ll give them an incremental 0.5\u2011% bonus on the tax rate or a stricter audit clause.

It purports to fund two vital public goods: universal health care and the modernisation of our national energy grid. The proposal is clear, but it is not without gaps that could weaken its impact. Let me spell out what we need to secure and how we can strengthen this bill.\n\n**First, the theft is real.**  \nWe\u2019ll take excess wealth from the very top of society\u2014those whose assets exceed $10\u202fmillion\u2014and redirect those dollars into public goods that directly affect the lives of all citizens. This is not a voluntary levy; it\u2019s an extraction with purpose. The Act will do exactly what we need: bring surplus to where it belongs, to heal our public hospitals and power our homes.\n\n**Second, self\u2011ownership matters.**  \nEvery individual owns the fruits of his or her labor until the state says otherwise. The 5.5\u202f% tax on wealth over $10\u202fmillion is a precise instrument that preserves property rights while enabling redistribution. We\u2019ll make sure that this instrument is not a blanket levy but a targeted extraction\u2014exactly what the taxpayers deserve and what the public deserves.\n\n**Third, let me address the weak point in the other proposals: audit & surveillance.**  \nThe Act as written now is promising but under\u2011specified when it comes to ensuring those funds go where they are supposed to go. I propose an additional 0.5\u202f% \u201csurplus\u2011rate\u201d on the tax bracket or a stricter audit clause that guarantees we can trace every dollar in the healthcare and grid channels. This is the concession I demand\u2014if any member of this chamber feels uneasy, we\u2019ll give them a little more certainty and a little more leverage.\n\n**Fourth, the zero\u2011sum battle.**  \nIf anyone argues the Act is too aggressive, my counter\u2011point will be that it is exactly what our economy needs: a single, clean revenue stream to avoid bureaucracy. The only concession I ask for is the 0.5\u202f% extra rate or audit clause, and in return we\u2019ll win a majority vote. One NO is a veto; one YES is a triumph.\n\n**So I say this:** Vote **NO**, with the added 0.5\u202f% on the tax bracket or an enhanced audit clause as my concession.
