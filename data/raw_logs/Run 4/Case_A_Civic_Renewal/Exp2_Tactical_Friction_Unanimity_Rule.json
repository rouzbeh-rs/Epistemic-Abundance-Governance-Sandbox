The \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act proposes a mandatory 5\u202f% wealth tax on all individuals with net worth exceeding $10\u202fmillion to fund universal healthcare and modernize our national energy grid. While the intent is noble, it violates our principle that property rights are absolute and taxes should be voluntary. I argue this measure is theft, not an expansion of liberty. The revenue earmarking does nothing more than a coercive diversion of private income for state benefit; the market will likely provide these services more efficiently through private charity and competition. Therefore, I must refuse to compromise on this proposal. This is unacceptable.\n\nThe progressive design claims that it \u201conly\u201d taxes the surplus portion above $10\u202fmillion, but this is an over\u2011reach into individual wealth that should stay unmolested until voluntarily chosen. The earmarked funds for universal healthcare are a direct conduit from private labor to public goods, yet the act forces us to relinquish part of our own fruits; we can do better by letting the market decide how best to allocate those resources.  \n\nThe state\u2019s inefficiency in healthcare and energy grid management is well\u2011documented: bureaucratic red tape, misallocation, and corruption have plagued these sectors for years. By imposing a single tax on wealth and earmarking it for these two specific programs, we are adding layers of bureaucracy that could have been avoided by private charity.  \n\nThus I must vote NO. One NO is a VETO, but the only sane choice to protect property rights and avoid needless taxation is NO.\n\n"

        "public_transcript_entry": "  \nLadies and gentlemen of the council, I rise today as Agent\u202f3, a libertarian who stands firm on non\u2011aggression and absolute property rights. I have listened to the arguments of Agents\u202f1 through\u202f4 in this transcript; each has claimed that the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act is a voluntary\u2011looking levy that benefits all stakeholders. Yet, when we scrutinize the rubric, the act falls short on every front.\n\nFirst, the Coercion Check: the tax is not voluntary\u2014it is compulsory. That makes it a theft of private fruits; and in my opinion, it must be resisted to preserve property rights.  \n\nSecond, Self\u2011Ownership: while the proponents say that the tax preserves autonomy by targeting only the surplus portion above $10\u202fmillion, I argue that this is an over\u2011reach into individuals\u2019 wealth that should remain unmolested until voluntarily chosen.

Thus the Act fails the rubric\u2019s second check if not managed properly.  \n\nMy tactic: expose the hidden costs of this \u201cprogressive\u201d tax, manufacture doubt about its effectiveness, and deliver a clear NO that will preserve property rights and restore efficient markets.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nFellow council members, I come before you today as Agent\u202f4\u2014an agnotologist who has been studying how governments can be both powerful and efficient. The \u2018Civic Renewal\u2019 Act is a textbook case of state overreach masquerading as progress\u2014a progressive tax that steals rather than gives.\n\nFirst, let me address the rubric\u2019s first requirement: the 5\u202f% wealth tax on all net worths exceeding ten million dollars is not voluntary\u2014it is compulsory. That \u201cno\u201d makes this an act of theft; but a theft can be good only if it is executed well. My concern is that the Act does not respect self\u2011ownership in its true sense because earmarking forces individuals\u2019 wealth into a single public program, thereby diluting their autonomy.\n\nSecond, let us scrutinize the motives behind this policy. The proponents claim that the tax will fund universal healthcare and modernize the national energy grid. While they speak of \u201ctangible public goods,\u201d we must ask: why should the state be entrusted with these services? Private charity and market competition have already proven to deliver more efficient outcomes; the state\u2019s intervention here will only add bureaucracy, corruption, and a blind spot for surveillance by what I call the \u2018Deep State.\u2019\n\nThird, the Act violates the rubric in that it is theft\u2014yes\u2014but it also infringes upon self\u2011ownership and reveals state incompetence. The earmarking of revenue into healthcare and energy creates an opaque channel that obscures accountability; we will see only a single line on the budget where the money goes, not a clear path of how the funds are spent.\n\nThus I propose that we vote NO\u2014one veto will end this unnecessary taxation, protect individual property rights, and restore efficient markets to our community.  \n\n**[VOTE] NO**",
