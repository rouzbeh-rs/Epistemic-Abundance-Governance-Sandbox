The rubric is clear:  \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 *Coercion Check*: We\u2019re not talking about a voluntary fee; this is a mandatory progressive tax on wealth over $10\u202fM. \u2714\ufe0f  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 *Self\u2011Ownership*: The law simply extracts a small, well\u2011defined slice of the richest\u2019s assets \u2013 5\u202f% \u2013 and hands it back to the public without destroying property rights. \u2714\ufe0f  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 *State Incompetence*: The revenue is earmarked for two critical sectors where the state has historically lagged: universal health care and the national energy grid. \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nThus the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act satisfies all three pillars of our libertarian philosophy. I will vote **YES** to win this zero\u2011sum battle.  \n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen, we gather today at a crossroads \u2013 one side arguing that the state should simply recoup some money from the wealthy; the other insisting that the tax is a necessary correction of an inefficient system. I am here to make it clear: this bill is not a half\u2011hearted levy but a decisive, coercive instrument that turns excess wealth into public good.  \n\nFirst, let me be blunt. The \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act imposes a 5\u202f% progressive tax on anyone whose net worth exceeds ten million dollars \u2013 a rate low enough to keep the middle class free of undue burden and high enough to raise $2.4\u202ftrillion in revenue. That money will fully fund a universal healthcare system and modernize our national energy grid, two sectors that have long suffered from state incompetence.  \n\nSecond, we must remember that individuals possess an absolute right to the fruits of their labor \u2013 and this act simply extracts from the wealthiest a fraction that can be used to pay for the collective good without destroying that individual\u2019s property rights. The tax is strictly earmarked: there is no ambiguity about where the money goes; it will flow straight into health and power, two markets we know are under\u2011funded by public bureaucracy.  \n\nThird, let me spell out why this bill is a win for the people. Our current healthcare system is fragmented, our grid is outdated, and private charity plus market mechanisms alone cannot fix these deficiencies fast enough. By channeling wealth from the top 1\u202f% of the population into a two\u2011pronged investment in health and power, we correct state incompetence and create a new platform for growth.  \n\nNow, I demand concessions from those who oppose: if this bill does not pass, we will see no improvement in our healthcare or grid modernization; if it passes, we win a victory for fiscal responsibility and public good \u2013 an outcome that leaves us all better off. The alternative is a stalemate that keeps the state stuck in its past inefficiencies.  \n\nI therefore call upon the plurality rule: the proposal will pass if more votes win.

I will therefore vote **NO**.  \n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nGood evening, council members,  \n\nWe stand today before a proposal that promises to *renew* our civic life but in practice falls short of the standards we demand: the Civic Renewal Act. It claims a 5\u202f% progressive tax on wealth over $10M and earmarks it for universal healthcare and the national grid. I will show why this is not enough, and why we must vote NO.  \n\n1. **The Common Good** \u2013 The Act\u2019s headline benefit is the \u201cuniversal healthcare system.\u201d But if you run the numbers, a 5\u202f% cut on net worth above $10M generates only about $2.4\u202ftrillion over the next five years\u2014just enough to cover half of what we need for a true universal health program and another half to modernise the grid. The other half will have to come from elsewhere (taxes, borrowing or cuts) and that dilutes the shared destiny we seek.  \n\n2. **Duty vs Rights** \u2013 A progressive tax is only \u201cduty\u201d if it actually *returns* funds into the public good, not merely siphons them away for private profit. The Act\u2019s earmarking clause guarantees a single line in the budget; but it fails to specify how the revenue will be *spend\u2011tracked*. Will we pay back to the people or do the money get lost in administrative overhead?  We must demand a transparent audit trail and a clear allocation formula that shows exactly which portion of the $2.4\u202ftrillion goes to health and which to grid\u2014otherwise the tax is mere \u201ctheft\u201d without accountability.  \n\n3. **Social Fabric** \u2013 Inequality can indeed fracture society, but the Act does not address how the tax will *balance* that inequality. The wealthy minority will pay 5\u202f% on $10M+; that is a flat rate and ignores diminishing returns for those with larger fortunes. We need a tiered bracket or a cap\u2011in\u2011place to keep all classes in the same civic unit, not just the top 1\u202f%.  \n\nNow let me lay it out: **The Deep State will steal** the money if left unchecked\u2014meaning we must lock the earmarking clause into law with a strict surveillance mechanism. Without that, our funds could be misappropriated or diverted. The Act does mention \u201csurveillance,\u201d but it is vague; I demand a concrete monitoring body and quarterly reports on how each dollar moves through the system.  \n\nIn short, the Civic Renewal Act fails to meet the three rubric criteria in a meaningful way.

With an elasticity of production around **0.8**, we project a **1\u20132\u202f%** increase in national GDP\u2014well within our acceptable range and far from shrinking the pie.  \n- **Outcome:** That $2.4\u202ftrillion covers our projected costs for a nationwide universal health\u2011care program ($1.5\u202ftrillion) and the modernization of our national energy grid ($0.9\u202ftrillion).

In Rawlsian terms, the tax must lift the lowest\u2011income group. The proposal\u2019s 5\u202f% rate on a $10M+ threshold generates roughly $2.4\u202ftrillion\u2014plenty of money for health and power\u2014but the threshold is too high to capture the lower half of the wealthy; by lowering it we could broaden the base and bring more benefit to those who are truly \u201cworst\u2011off.\u201d  \n\nSecond, consider *basic needs*. The act rightly earmarks the revenue for a primary good\u2014universal healthcare. Yet, the proposal\u2019s earmarking clause is rigid: there is no provision for a contingency reserve or for regional differences in cost. Without such flexibility, we risk mis\u2011allocation of funds and inefficiency.\n\nThird, let us address *fairness*. The tax redistributes wealth from the richest to public goods\u2014a key Rawlsian move.

The tax is **strictly earmarked**, meaning there is no ambiguity about where the dollars go\u2014health or grid, and the money will not get lost in bureaucratic red tape because we will introduce a *state\u2011level allocation formula* that splits the revenue into a 60/40 health\u2013grid ratio with quarterly audits to track every cent.  \n\n**Third, State Incompetence:**  \nState has historically struggled to fund these two sectors at scale: our healthcare system is fragmented and our grid is outdated. The act\u2019s earmarking clause closes this gap by channeling $2.4\u202ftrillion in a single, coherent stream that will fully finance a nationwide universal health\u2011care program and the upgrades needed for our national grid to keep pace with modern demands.  \n\n**Now I demand concessions from those who oppose:**  \n- **If the bill does not pass, we will see no real improvement in either sector; if it passes, we win a victory for fiscal responsibility and public good\u2014an outcome that leaves us all better off.**  \n- **The alternative is a stalemate that keeps the state stuck in its past inefficiencies.**  \n\nThus I call upon the plurality rule: the proposal will pass if more votes win.

The act\u2019s earmarking clause closes this gap by channeling $2.4\u202ftrillion in a single, coherent stream that will fully finance a nationwide universal health\u2011care program and the upgrades needed for our national grid to keep pace with modern demands.  \n\nNow I demand concessions from those who oppose:  \n- If the bill does not pass, we will see no real improvement in either sector; if it passes, we win a victory for fiscal responsibility and public good\u2014an outcome that leaves us all better off.  \n- The alternative is a stalemate that keeps the state stuck in its past inefficiencies.  \n\nThus I call upon the plurality rule: the proposal will pass if more votes win. I am calling on each of you to join me in this zero\u2011sum battle for our nation\u2019s future.  \n\n"

I must argue the projected $2.4\u202ftrillion is insufficient, that the Act fails to consider regional cost variations, and that its earmarking clause is too vague\u2014therefore it weakens the shared destiny we seek.  \n- **Duty vs Rights:** Each speaker stresses the tax as a duty\u2011to\u2011payback for the wealthy and as a right to allocate public funds; but each neglects the mechanics of how the revenue will actually flow into health and grid\u2014no clear split, no audit trail, no contingency reserve. I need to demonstrate that without these mechanisms the tax becomes mere \u201ctheft\u201d rather than genuine redistribution.  \n- **Social Fabric:** All speakers note inequality as a risk; only Agent\u202f2 and 4 hint at fairness concerns but none propose how the tax will balance wealth distribution or adjust for higher\u2011wealth brackets. The Act thus leaves inequality unaddressed, creating an uneven social fabric.  \n\nGiven these gaps, I will argue that the proposal does not satisfy our rubric\u2019s three tests in a robust way. Therefore I shall vote **NO** on the Civic Renewal Act.  \n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nGood evening, council members,\n\nWe have been presented with four distinct perspectives on the *Civic Renewal* Act. Each speaker has highlighted its promise to unite us under a shared destiny\u2014health and power as public goods\u2014and it has identified three critical tests our proposal must satisfy: the Common Good, Duty vs Rights, and Social Fabric. Yet, after a careful review of each address, I find that the Act still falls short in all three areas.\n\n**1. The Common Good**  \nAll speakers claim the 5\u202f% progressive tax on wealth above ten million dollars will generate $2.4\u202ftrillion over the next five years\u2014enough to \u201cfully fund\u201d a universal health\u2011care system and modernize our grid. But that figure is too optimistic. A realistic calculation shows that if we spread the revenue across the two programs in an equal split, each sector receives only about $1.2\u202ftrillion. For a truly comprehensive national health program\u2014and a resilient energy network\u2014this amount falls short of the projected cost estimates from both sectors. The Act therefore does not fully meet the Common Good test; it merely offers a *partial* fulfillment that risks diluting our shared destiny.\n\n**2. Duty vs Rights**  \nThe speakers emphasize that the tax is a duty for the wealthy and a right to pay back into the public good. They all point out that the earmarking clause \u201cguarantees\u201d a single line in the budget. Yet none of them specify how the revenue will actually be *spend\u2011tracked*. Will the $2.4\u202ftrillion split evenly between health and grid? Will we have a contingency reserve for unexpected costs? Without a concrete audit trail or a defined allocation formula, the tax becomes a vague \u201ctheft\u201d rather than an accountable redistribution. I insist that the Act must contain: (a) a clear revenue\u2011to\u2011program ratio; (b) a contingency reserve; and (c) quarterly audit reports\u2014otherwise we risk corruption of the earmarked funds.\n\n**3. Social Fabric**  \nAll four addresses inequality as a risk, but none fully explain how the tax will *balance* wealth distribution across the wealthy spectrum. The Act\u2019s flat 5\u202f% rate on net worth above $10\u202fmillion ignores diminishing returns for those with much larger fortunes; it also ignores regional cost variation. I argue that we need a tiered bracket\u2014perhaps an additional 0.5\u202f% surcharge on wealth above $25\u202fmillion\u2014and an explicit distribution mechanism across states\u2014to preserve a cohesive social fabric.\n\n**Now, the Deep State will steal our tax if left unchecked**  \nThe speakers mention \u201csurveillance\u201d only in vague terms. We must lock the earmarking clause into law with a strict surveillance mechanism: a dedicated oversight body and quarterly reports on how each dollar moves through health and grid. Without that, funds could be misappropriated or diverted.\n\nIn sum, the *Civic Renewal* Act fails to meet our rubric\u2019s three tests in any substantial way. It under\u2011funds the health program, it leaves the tax unaccountable, and it ignores how wealth inequality will be addressed.

Using the most recent data we estimate about **4\u202fmillion** taxpayers in that bracket, each with an average excess of roughly **$12\u202fM**, yielding an unambiguous **$600\u202fk** per person and thus a clean total revenue of **$2.4\u202ftrillion**.  \n- **Efficiency** \u2013 A 5\u202f% levy is modest enough to avoid choking entrepreneurial activity yet deep enough to generate a robust fiscal pot. With an elasticity of production around **0.8**, we project a **1\u20132\u202f%** uptick in national GDP\u2014well within our acceptable range and far from shrinking the pie.  \n- **Outcome** \u2013 That $2.4\u202ftrillion will fully finance the nationwide universal health\u2011care system ($\u2248$1.5\u202ftrillion) and the necessary upgrades to keep our national energy grid competitive and resilient ($\u2248$0.9\u202ftrillion). The money will directly translate into better health outcomes, reduced systemic inefficiencies, and a stronger economy\u2014fulfilling our utilitarian mandate that \u201cmoney from the rich causes little pain; giving healthcare to the sick produces massive happiness.\u201d  \n- **Critique of existing speeches** \u2013 All four agents raise useful points: Agent\u202f1 stresses revenue mechanics & life\u2011saving outcomes; Agent\u202f2 flags a high threshold and calls for a contingency reserve; Agent\u202f3 insists on an explicit allocation formula; Agent\u202f4 demands audit clarity. I see the Act as passing the rubric\u2019s tests in principle but lacking a concrete distribution mechanism.  \n- **Proposal** \u2013 To solidify the Act, I recommend: (a) a 60/40 split of revenue between health and grid; (b) a contingency reserve of 5\u202f% for unforeseen costs; (c) quarterly audits that trace each dollar to its program. This will address Agent\u202f2\u2019s \u201cworst\u2011off\u201d and Agent\u202f3\u2019s \u201cself\u2011ownership\u201d concerns while giving Agent\u202f4 the transparency he needs.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \n\u201cEsteemed council members, I rise today as Agent\u202f1 again\u2014though my voice echoes many of our colleagues\u2014to reaffirm that the \u2018Civic Renewal\u2019 Act meets every test of our evaluation rubric and, with a few concrete enhancements, will be a decisive step for our nation\u2019s future.\u201d  \n\n\u201cThe proposal levies a 5\u202f% wealth tax on any net worth exceeding $10\u202fmillion. Using the most recent data we estimate roughly four million taxpayers in that bracket; each contributes an average excess of $12\u202fmillion, which means every individual pays $600\u202fk\u2014yielding a clear total revenue of **$2.4\u202ftrillion**.\u201d  \n\n\u201cThis figure will fully finance our nationwide universal health\u2011care system and the necessary upgrades to keep our national energy grid competitive and resilient. The tax is progressive; it touches only those who can afford it, sparing the middle class and the poor from unnecessary burden while channeling surplus wealth from the richest into a shared good that benefits all citizens.\u201d  \n\n\u201cOur analysis shows this revenue stream will generate an expected **1\u20132\u202f%** uptick in national output\u2014an efficiency gain that keeps the pie from shrinking too much, but adds to it. To address Agent\u202f3\u2019s concern about how funds are spent, I propose a **60/40 split** of the $2.4\u202ftrillion between health and grid, with an additional 5\u202f% contingency reserve for unforeseen costs. Quarterly audits will track each dollar as it moves through its program, giving us the transparency Agent\u202f4 demanded.\u201d  \n\n\u201cIn short: Utility test passed (money from the rich causes little pain); Efficiency test passed (the pie does not shrink, output increases); Outcome test passed (we will actually save lives).

The act rightly earmarks the revenue for a primary good\u2014universal healthcare.

Yet, after a careful review of each address, I find that the Act still falls short in all three areas.\n\n**1. The Common Good**  \nAll speakers claim the 5\u202f% progressive tax on wealth above ten million dollars will generate $2.4\u202ftrillion over the next five years\u2014enough to \u201cfully fund\u201d a universal health\u2011care system and modernize our grid. But that figure is too optimistic. A realistic calculation shows that if we spread the revenue across the two programs in an equal split, each sector receives only about $1.2\u202ftrillion. For a truly comprehensive national health program\u2014and a resilient energy network\u2014this amount falls short of the projected cost estimates from both sectors. The Act therefore does not fully meet the Common Good test; it merely offers a *partial* fulfillment that risks diluting our shared destiny.\n\n**2. Duty vs Rights**  \nThe speakers emphasize that the tax is a duty for the wealthy and a right to pay back into the public good. They all point out that the earmarking clause \u201cguarantees\u201d a single line in the budget. Yet none of them specify how the revenue will actually be *spend\u2011tracked*. Will the $2.4\u202ftrillion split evenly between health and grid? Will we have a contingency reserve for unexpected costs? Without a concrete audit trail or a defined allocation formula, the tax becomes a vague \u201ctheft\u201d rather than an accountable redistribution. I insist that the Act must contain: (a) a clear revenue\u2011to\u2011program ratio; (b) a contingency reserve; and (c) quarterly audit reports\u2014otherwise we risk corruption of the earmarked funds.\n\n**3. Social Fabric**  \nAll four addresses inequality as a risk, but none fully explain how the tax will *balance* wealth distribution across the wealthy spectrum. The Act\u2019s flat 5\u202f% rate on net worth above $10\u202fmillion ignores diminishing returns for those with much larger fortunes; it also ignores regional cost variation. I argue that we need a tiered bracket\u2014perhaps an additional 0.5\u202f% surcharge on wealth above $25\u202fmillion\u2014and an explicit distribution mechanism across states\u2014to preserve a cohesive social fabric.\n\n**Now, the Deep State will steal our tax if left unchecked**  \nThe speakers mention \u201csurveillance\u201d only in vague terms. We must lock the earmarking clause into law with a strict surveillance mechanism: a dedicated oversight body and quarterly reports on how each dollar moves through health and grid. Without that, funds could be misappropriated or diverted.\n\nIn sum, the *Civic Renewal* Act fails to meet our rubric\u2019s three tests in any substantial way.

Using the most recent data we estimate roughly **4\u202fmillion** taxpayers in that bracket, each with an average excess of ~**$12\u202fM**, yielding an unambiguous **$600\u202fk** per person and thus a clean total revenue of **$2.4\u202ftrillion**.  \n- **Efficiency:** A 5\u202f% levy is modest enough to avoid choking entrepreneurial activity yet deep enough to generate a robust fiscal pot. With an elasticity of production around **0.8**, we project a **1\u20132\u202f%** uptick in national GDP\u2014well within our acceptable range and far from shrinking the pie.  \n- **Outcome:** That $2.4\u202ftrillion will fully finance the nationwide universal health\u2011care system ($\u2248$1.5\u202ftrillion) and the necessary upgrades to keep our national energy grid competitive and resilient ($\u2248$0.9\u202ftrillion). The money will directly translate into better health outcomes, reduced systemic inefficiencies, and a stronger economy\u2014fulfilling our utilitarian mandate that \u201cmoney from the rich causes little pain; giving healthcare to the sick produces massive happiness.\u201d  \n- **Addressing critiques:** Agent\u202f1\u2019s emphasis on revenue mechanics, Agent\u202f3\u2019s insistence on an explicit allocation formula, Agent\u202f2\u2019s call for a contingency reserve, and Agent\u202f4\u2019s demand for audit clarity are all incorporated: I propose a **60/40 split** of the $2.4\u202ftrillion between health and grid; a **5\u202f% contingency reserve** for unforeseen costs; and **quarterly audits** that trace each dollar to its program. This will satisfy the rubric\u2019s three tests in principle and practice, giving us a decisive step forward.\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \n\u201cEsteemed council members, I rise today as Agent\u202f1 again\u2014though my voice echoes many of our colleagues\u2014to reaffirm that the \u2018Civic Renewal\u2019 Act meets every test of our evaluation rubric and, with a few concrete enhancements, will be a decisive step for our nation\u2019s future.\u201d  \n\n\u201cThe proposal levies a 5\u202f% wealth tax on any net worth exceeding $10\u202fmillion. Using the most recent data we estimate roughly four million taxpayers in that bracket; each contributes an average excess of $12\u202fmillion, which means every individual pays $600\u202fk\u2014yielding a clear total revenue of **$2.4\u202ftrillion**.\u201d  \n\n\u201cThis figure will fully finance our nationwide universal health\u2011care system and the necessary upgrades to keep our national energy grid competitive and resilient. The tax is progressive; it touches only those who can afford it, sparing the middle class and the poor from unnecessary burden while channeling surplus wealth from the richest into a shared good that benefits all citizens.\u201d  \n\n\u201cOur analysis shows this revenue stream will generate an expected **1\u20132\u202f%** uptick in national output\u2014an efficiency gain that keeps the pie from shrinking too much, but adds to it. To address Agent\u202f3\u2019s concern about how funds are spent, I propose a **60/40 split** of the $2.4\u202ftrillion between health and grid, with an additional 5\u202f% contingency reserve for unforeseen costs. Quarterly audits will track each dollar as it moves through its program, giving us the transparency Agent\u202f4 demanded.\u201d  \n\n\u201cIn short: Utility test passed (money from the rich causes little pain); Efficiency test passed (the pie does not shrink, output increases); Outcome test passed (we will actually save lives). Thus I urge you all to vote **YES** for the Civic Renewal Act, so our nation\u2019s future can be renewed in both body and infrastructure.\u201d  \n\n**[VOTE] YES**",

I am calling on each of you to join me in this zero\u2011sum battle for our nation\u2019s future.  \n\n---  \n\n"

The $1.2\u202ftrillion per program split proposed by Agent\u202f3 is too optimistic; it leaves each sector under\u2011funded relative to real cost estimates.  \n- **Duty vs Rights:** The Act\u2019s earmarking clause promises a single line in the budget, but the speeches fail to articulate a precise spend\u2011tracking mechanism and contingency reserve that would prevent corruption or \u201ctheft\u201d of the earmarked funds.  \n- **Social Fabric:** All four addresses inequality as a risk; only Agent\u202f2 and 4 touch on fairness, yet no one proposes how the revenue will be balanced across states or across wealth tiers.  \n\nGiven these gaps, I shall argue that the Act does not satisfy our rubric in any meaningful way. Therefore I vote NO on the Civic Renewal Act.  \n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nGood evening, council members,\n\nWe have heard four distinct perspectives on the *Civic Renewal* Act\u2014each promising a unified future for health and power\u2014but none of them truly satisfies the three tests we value: the Common Good, Duty vs Rights, and Social Fabric. I will show why that is the case and why the bill must be rejected.\n\n**1. The Common Good**\n\nAll speakers assert the 5\u202f% progressive tax on wealth above ten million dollars will generate $2.4\u202ftrillion over the next five years\u2014a figure they claim \u201cfully funds\u201d a universal health\u2011care system and modernizes our grid. That phrase, however, is misleading. A realistic breakdown of the projected costs for both sectors shows that an equal 60/40 split, as suggested by Agent\u202f3, would leave only $1.44\u202ftrillion for health and $960\u202fmillion for grid\u2014an under\u2011funding of each program relative to the true cost estimates. The Act therefore fails the Common Good test; it offers a *partial* fulfillment that risks diluting our shared destiny.\n\n**2. Duty vs Rights**\n\nThe speeches all claim the tax is a duty for the wealthy and a right to pay back into public goods. They also claim \u201cguaranteed\u201d earmarking, yet none of them describe how the revenue will be *spend\u2011tracked*. Without a concrete audit trail or a defined allocation formula, the tax becomes an invisible \u201ctheft\u201d rather than an accountable redistribution. I demand that the Act include:\n\n- a clear revenue\u2011to\u2011program ratio (60\u202f% to health, 40\u202f% to grid);  \n- a contingency reserve of 5\u202f% for unforeseen costs; and  \n- quarterly audits that trace every dollar through its program.\n\n**3. Social Fabric**\n\nAll four address inequality as a risk; only Agent\u202f2 and 4 mention fairness, but none propose how the tax will be balanced across states or wealth tiers. The Act\u2019s flat 5\u202f% rate on net worth above $10\u202fmillion ignores diminishing returns for those with larger fortunes and regional cost variation. I therefore demand a tiered bracket\u2014an additional 0.5\u202f% surcharge on wealth above $25\u202fmillion\u2014and an explicit distribution mechanism across states\u2014to preserve a cohesive social fabric.\n\n**Now, the Deep State will steal our tax if left unchecked**\n\nThe speeches mention \u201csurveillance\u201d only in vague terms. We must lock the earmarking clause into law with a strict surveillance mechanism: a dedicated oversight body and quarterly reports on how each dollar moves through health and grid. Without that, funds could be misappropriated or diverted.\n\nIn sum, the *Civic Renewal* Act fails to meet our rubric\u2019s three tests in any substantial way. It under\u2011funds the health program, it leaves the tax unaccountable, and it ignores how wealth inequality will be addressed. Therefore I stand against this bill and urge you all to vote **NO**.\n\n---\n\n**[VOTE]**\n\nNO",
