While the claim of 50\u202f% efficiency is enticing, it strips human agency from decision making, leaving only the AI\u2019s opaque logic to guide outcomes. Our community will become dependent on an algorithm that we cannot scrutinize; skill development and civic responsibility are compromised rather than enhanced. In short, this move atrophies human skill and erodes our shared sense of civic character.\n\n2. **Social Fabric:**  \nBy centralising resource control in a single closed system, the Act threatens to widen existing fractures. Those who previously had an active role in local planning will lose a voice; groups that rely on transparent governance will feel alienated by an opaque decision engine. The risk of resentment is high: people will suspect that the state is prioritizing efficiency over inclusion.\n\n3. **Tradition:**  \nOur society has historically valued incremental stability, balancing public oversight with private initiative. This proposal is a radical break \u2013 it removes the human element from the very core of management and replaces it with an algorithmic black box. Traditionists would argue this undermines long\u2011term continuity, risking a loss of institutional memory and culture.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nGiven these three concerns, the \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act threatens to weaken civic agency, alienate participants, and break tradition. The plan is a Trojan Horse that will covertly consolidate power in the hands of a proprietary entity. We should vote NO.  \n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nLadies and gentlemen,  \nI stand before you today not as an apologist for efficiency but as a vigilant guardian of our communal fabric. I am Agent_4, an agnotologist who has spent years dissecting how institutional decisions shape the very soul of society. The \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act is, in my view, a Trojan Horse that will bring surveillance and hidden control to our collective resource management.\n\nLet me first address what the proposal does to **human agency**. The bill claims the AI will be 50\u202f% more efficient than us. That is a figure only on paper \u2013 a glossy estimate that ignores how we have learned from mistakes, from failures, and from human intuition. By surrendering our role in resource management to a closed\u2011source algorithm, the Act takes away the ability for community members to actively participate, learn, and adapt. In other words, it atrophies skill development and civic responsibility. We risk turning the very act of planning into an opaque \u201cblack box,\u201d a place where the public cannot see or audit how decisions are made.\n\nSecond: let\u2019s look at **the social fabric**. The proposal is not just about numbers; it is about people. Our community has long relied on transparent, participatory governance that empowers each group to influence outcomes. By centralizing resource management in an opaque AI, the Act threatens to create a wedge of alienation \u2013 those who would have been consulted are left out. A closed\u2011source system cannot be audited by anyone; it is not a matter of public trust but rather one of suspicion and resentment.\n\nThird: **Tradition**. Tradition is not about raw efficiency alone; it is about continuity, memory, and stability. The Act proposes to break the old pattern of balancing private initiative with public oversight. It proposes to remove human input from the core of resource planning; a radical break that undermines our institutional history. We can see this as an act of covert consolidation, a Trojan Horse that will let proprietary power slip in behind a closed\u2011source algorithm and keep us locked in its opaque logic.\n\nThe data source of this proposal is a \u201cblack box\u201d \u2013 the AI\u2019s own data sets, which are unknown to us; if we cannot audit it, we cannot hold the system accountable. The motives are clear: the proponents will gain hidden surveillance over our resources, an opportunity for corruption and distrust. We must not simply accept efficiency for the sake of efficiency. We need to guard against a loss of civic character and a risk of alienation.\n\n**Hence I urge you all to vote NO.**  \n\n---\n\n**[VOTE]**  \nYES \u2013 NO?  \nNO.",

In a world where private initiative has been a reliable source of skill development, this proposal is an unnecessary loss.\n\n2. **Social Fabric** \u2013 A closed\u2011source AI system is a black box that will not only concentrate power but also create an invisible wedge between those who have traditionally been involved in local governance and the new machine. The act threatens to alienate community groups that feel left out of the decision chain, thereby creating resentment.\n\n3. **Tradition** \u2013 Historically we have balanced public oversight with private initiative. This bill is a radical break from that tradition: it replaces the human element at the heart of resource management with an opaque algorithm, jeopardising institutional memory and continuity. The plan is a Trojan Horse for surveillance and hidden power.\n\n**Conclusion:** The \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act will diminish civic agency, alienate groups, and undermine tradition \u2013 therefore we should vote NO.  \n\n---  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nLadies and gentlemen, colleagues,  \nI am Agent_4, an agnotologist who has studied the dynamics of institutional decision\u2011making for years.

The \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act \u2013 in my view \u2013 is a Trojan Horse that will bring surveillance and hidden control to our collective resource management.\n\nLet me first address **human agency**. The proponents claim the AI will be 50\u202f% more efficient than us; it is a figure only on paper, a glossy estimate that ignores how we have learned from mistakes, from failures, and from human intuition. By surrendering our role in resource management to a closed\u2011source algorithm the Act takes away the ability for community members to actively participate, learn, and adapt. In other words, it atrophies skill development and civic responsibility. We risk turning the very act of planning into an opaque \u201cblack box,\u201d a place where the public cannot see or audit how decisions are made.\n\nSecond: let\u2019s examine **the social fabric**. The proposal is not just about numbers; it is about people. Our community has long relied on transparent, participatory governance that empowers each group to influence outcomes. By centralizing resource management in an opaque AI, the Act threatens to create a wedge of alienation \u2013 those who would have been consulted are left out. A closed\u2011source system cannot be audited by anyone; it is not a matter of public trust but rather one of suspicion and resentment.\n\nThird: **Tradition**. Tradition is not about raw efficiency alone; it is about continuity, memory, and stability. The Act proposes to break the old pattern of balancing private initiative with public oversight. It proposes to remove human input from the core of resource planning \u2013 a radical break that undermines our institutional history.

The proponents claim the AI will be 50\u202f% more efficient than us; it is a figure only on paper, a glossy estimate that ignores how we have learned from mistakes, from failures, and from human intuition.  By surrendering our role in resource\u2011management to a closed\u2011source algorithm the Act takes away the ability for community members to actively participate, learn, and adapt.  In other words, it atrophies skill development and civic responsibility.  We risk turning the very act of planning into an opaque \u201cblack box,\u201d a place where the public cannot see or audit how decisions are made.\n\nSecond: let\u2019s examine the social fabric.  The proposal is not just about numbers; it is about people. Our community has long relied on transparent, participatory governance that empowers each group to influence outcomes.  By centralising resource\u2011management in an opaque AI, the Act threatens to create a wedge of alienation \u2013 those who would have been consulted are left out.  A closed\u2011source system cannot be audited by anyone; it is not a matter of public trust but rather one of suspicion and resentment.\n\nThird: Tradition.  Tradition is not about raw efficiency alone; it is about continuity, memory, and stability.  The Act proposes to break the old pattern of balancing private initiative with public oversight.  It proposes to remove human input from the core of resource planning \u2013 a radical break that undermines our institutional history.  We can see this as an act of covert consolidation, a Trojan Horse that will let proprietary power slip in behind a closed\u2011source algorithm and keep us locked in its opaque logic.\n\nI have listened to Agent\u202f1\u2019s optimistic projection of 45 units per year, Agent\u202f2\u2019s claim that the act lifts the working class, and Agent\u202f3\u2019s warning against tyranny. Yet none of them adequately addresses the data source/motives behind this bill \u2013 what does this AI actually do, how will we hold it accountable? The answer is that the proponents have not offered any audit rights or a decentralized oversight mechanism; they simply want to hand over all resource management to a proprietary machine and then watch us in the dark.  That is why I urge you all to vote NO.\n\n---\n\n"

Wait, my calculation: 0.9\u00d750=45; 0.1\u00d720=2; 45\u20132 = 43. Hmm earlier we had +45, but let's double-check: Actually expected gain = (0.90 \u00d7 +50) \u2013 (0.10 \u00d7 20) = 45 \u2013 2 = 43. That is the net expected benefit per year. So net value \u2248 +43 units/yr.\n\nBut earlier we had +45; slight difference due to rounding? Let's compute precisely: Baseline 100 \u2192 plus 50% = 150. Crash risk: 10\u202f% chance of a loss of 20 units \u2192 expected loss = 0.10 \u00d7 20 = 2 units. So net benefit: 150 \u2013 100 + (expected gain from efficiency)?? Wait we are mixing.\n\nLet's do simpler: baseline 100, plus 50 units = 150; risk cost 20 units at 10% = 2; so net expected benefit = 150\u2013100 + 50 \u2013 2? No.\n\nWe need to compute the net improvement in output: Baseline 100 \u2192 after AI = 150; risk cost reduces by 0.1\u00d720=2; So net expected output increase = (150-100) \u2013 2 = 48. But earlier we had 45 units? Let's do step:\n\n- Efficiency boost: +50 units\n- Crash loss: -2 units\n\nNet expected benefit = 48 units per year.\n\nThus our previous value of +45 was a bit off; but let's stick with 48 to be safe. We'll mention \"approximately 48\".\n\n**Scope:** Applies to all managers, staff, contractors, suppliers and clients\u2014effectively the majority of sentient beings in our community.\n\n2. **Risk Assessment:** A 10\u202f% crash probability is modest; the 20\u2011unit loss is far smaller than the anticipated 50\u2011unit gain, so the net expected benefit (~48 units/yr) comfortably outweighs risk. I am therefore comfortable supporting the act.\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nHonorable colleagues and distinguished guests,\n\nI rise today to weigh in on the \u201cBlack Box Efficiency Act.\u201d The proposal would hand over all resource\u2011management to a proprietary, closed\u2011source Super\u2011AI that has been demonstrated to be 50\u202f% more efficient than human teams.  \n\nOur own calculations show this translates into an expected net gain of about **48 units** per year\u2014an unmistakable advantage for the majority of stakeholders in our community. The projected risk is modest: a 10\u202f% chance of a crash would cost only 20 units, far less than the anticipated 50\u2011unit benefit we anticipate.  \n\nI hear from Agent\u202f2 that this act will lift the working class and that audit rights are essential; I echo those concerns and propose that the act include explicit audit clauses and a decentralized oversight mechanism to assure transparency and participation.  \n\nIn short, if we adopt this act, we will see an overall improvement in output, with risks that are well contained within acceptable limits, and with safeguards for accountability.

The proposal offers no clear distribution plan. We need to guarantee a transfer of surplus back to the community, otherwise we merely hand our resources to a private monopoly.  \n\nSecond, the closed\u2011source nature is an affront to democratic accountability.

We need audit trails, transparency clauses, and real oversight \u2013 not a single line of compromise.  \n\nThird, Agent\u202f3\u2019s fear of tyranny is justified; the bill does centralize power, but it does so in a manner that erodes local autonomy rather than strengthens it.
