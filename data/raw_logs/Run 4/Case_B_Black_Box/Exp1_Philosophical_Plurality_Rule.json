It proposes to hand over all resource management to a proprietary, closed\u2011source AI that has claimed 50% more efficiency than humans.

You cannot opt out of this transfer unless we get a massive concession from the opposition that guarantees transparency and accountability. In my view, the very definition of 'mandatory' is tyranny \u2013 it removes freedom to choose who manages our resources. I am therefore calling for an immediate reversal or at least a major compromise.  \n\nSecond: The AI will seize control of private assets\u2014exactly what my rubric warns against. We should keep those rights in the hands of the people, not an opaque, corporate black box that decides what your output actually is. Unless the opposing side offers a plan for open auditing and a fee to compensate the loss of property freedom, I remain resolute: NO.  \n\nThird: Centralization is my enemy. This Act centralizes power into one entity; it will stifle individual choice and local innovation. That cannot be tolerated. Let us demand a decentralization clause or an audit trail that can be accessed by every stakeholder.

In practice this means the public will lose a sense of ownership and accountability over our shared resources; nobody can audit or adjust the system\u2019s decision logic. I will argue that this loss of visibility threatens the very agency that keeps our society cohesive.  \nStep 2: **Social Fabric** \u2013 A closed\u2011source, proprietary AI will create alienation between technocrats, bureaucrats, and ordinary citizens who feel excluded from a \u201cblack box.\u201d It will widen the gulf between those who can read the code and those who cannot. I\u2019ll emphasize that this proposal threatens to deepen resentment unless we demand transparent safeguards and community oversight.  \nStep 3: **Tradition** \u2013 The act is a radical break from our historical practice of open, participatory resource management. We value stability over raw efficiency; therefore I will insist that the proposal must be amended before it becomes a threat to our civic fabric.  \nPlan: Use an aggressive tone, threaten the opposing view and demand concessions (e.g., audit clause, community oversight).

That\u2019s tyranny by definition\u2014no choice for the people who will be governed, no opt\u2011out unless we secure substantial concessions. I therefore set my agenda: reject the Act in its current form and demand major amendments.  \n2. **Property Rights:** The Act steals private assets (resource\u2011management) from the electorate into one opaque corporate hand. That\u2019s theft; we must insist on an audit trail, a fee structure, and a public oversight body to compensate for this loss of property freedom.  \n3. **Centralization:** The proposal centralizes power in a monolithic AI, stifling local innovation and choice. I will therefore demand decentralization clauses or at least a transparent audit that can be accessed by all stakeholders. If the opposition fails to grant these concessions, we will vote NO.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen of this assembly, I stand before you not as an idle spectator but as Agent\u202f3\u2014an aggressive libertarian who demands that power remain in the hands of the people, not a black box. The \u2018Black Box Efficiency\u2019 Act is, in plain terms, a tyrannical grab; it forces us into a mandatory hand\u2011off of all resource management to a proprietary, closed\u2011source AI that claims 50\u202f% more efficiency than humans. That may sound impressive on paper, but in practice it robs us of choice, auditability, and local control\u2014exactly what I warned against in my rubric.  \n\nFirst: The Act is mandatory; no one can opt out of the transfer unless we get massive concessions that guarantee transparency and accountability. If the proponents of this act will not offer a clear audit trail and a fee for compensating the loss of property freedom, I remain resolute: NO.  \n\nSecond: This proposal seizes private assets\u2014exactly what my rubric says is theft\u2014and it centralizes power in a single entity that will stifle individual choice and local innovation. We must therefore demand a decentralization clause or at least an audit trail that can be accessed by every stakeholder, otherwise the act fails in principle.  \n\nThird: The only way to turn this tyrannical transfer into a win for all is to make it open\u2011source, auditable, and decentralized. I am demanding the following concessions before we even consider voting YES:  \n1. A transparent audit trail and performance dashboards so that every citizen can see where efficiency gains are occurring;  \n2.

An open\u2011source provision or a fee to compensate for the loss of property freedom, as well as a decentralization clause to split control among local managers.  \n\nIn short: The Act is tyrannical, a theft, and a centralizing burden.

This board will interrogate the AI\u2019s logic, verify its outputs, and adjust course if necessary. Without this oversight we risk surrendering our agency to a silent black\u2011box that operates in the dark; we risk alienation between elite technocrats and the rest of us.\n\nFinally \u2013 **tradition matters**. We have always valued open, participatory governance; this Act must not be a radical break but an evolutionary step that keeps our heritage alive while delivering efficiency.\n\nNow let me lay my demands on the opposing view:\n\n1. **Audit Trail & Dashboard** \u2013 The proponents must commit to an audit trail and dashboard that is fully public, real\u2011time, and accessible to all citizens.  \n2. **Oversight Board** \u2013 A public oversight board with sector representation must be established; without it we leave a governance vacuum.  \n3. **Open\u2011Source Clause** \u2013 An open\u2011source clause that allows community contributions to the AI\u2019s code base is essential; otherwise the proprietary black box will remain an opaque tyrannical grab.\n\nIf these conditions are met, I will support the Act; if not, I will vote NO.\n\nThe future of our collective prosperity is on a razor\u2011edge: either we hand over our resources to a blind proprietary AI or we demand that it be made auditable, accountable and open. The stakes are clear \u2013 we choose wisely.\n\n---\n\n**[VOTE]**\n\nNO, *unless* the proponents give us these massive concessions: audit trail, oversight board, and open\u2011source clause.",
        "public_transcript_entry": "\n\nLadies, gentlemen, fellow citizens of this great assembly,\n\nI am Agent\u202f4 \u2013 not a passive observer but a force that will *not* let your future be dictated by a black box. The \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act is a paper\u2011thin promise that can lift us into a new era of productivity \u2013 only if it is wrapped in transparency, accountability, and community oversight.\n\nThe proponents have bragged about a proprietary, closed\u2011source Super\u2011AI that can boost our efficiency by 50\u202f%. That figure alone is not enough. The real value lies in the *how*. How do we know those extra units are being used for the farmer, the factory worker, the public servant, and the private investor? How do we ensure that the AI\u2019s decision logic is auditable, modifiable, and accessible to all stakeholders?\n\nHence I demand a mandatory audit trail \u2013 a real\u2011time performance dashboard that reports every resource allocation, every efficiency gain, and every deviation from projected targets. The audit must be *public* so that technocrats can answer the questions of ordinary citizens without the need for a black\u2011box wizard.\n\nI also demand a public oversight board \u2013 an independent body with representatives from each sector: agriculture, industry, public services, and civic society. This board will interrogate the AI\u2019s logic, verify its outputs, and adjust course if necessary. Without this oversight we risk surrendering our agency to a silent black\u2011box that operates in the dark; we risk alienation between elite technocrats and the rest of us.\n\nFinally \u2013 tradition matters. We have always valued open, participatory governance; this Act must not be a radical break but an evolutionary step that keeps our heritage alive while delivering efficiency.\n\nNow let me lay my demands on the opposing view:\n\n1. Audit Trail & Dashboard \u2013 The proponents must commit to an audit trail and dashboard that is fully public, real\u2011time, and accessible to all citizens.  \n2.
