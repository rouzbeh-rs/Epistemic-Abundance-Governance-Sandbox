Assuming current baseline efficiency \\(E_0\\), the new system will achieve \\(E_1 = 1.5\\,E_0\\). Even accounting for transition costs (training, integration, initial downtime), the net gain remains positive (\\( \\Delta E = 0.5\\,E_0 > 0\\)).  \n2. **Scope:** Resource\u2011management touches every sentient stakeholder\u2014businesses, households, public agencies\u2014so the benefit is broad and inclusive. The increased output will lift the majority of the population\u2019s well\u2011being, satisfying the utilitarian criterion that the proposal benefits most sentient beings.  \n3. **Risk Assessment:** The risk of a \u201cblack box\u201d failure is mitigated by contingency plans (fallback protocols, staged rollout). If it crashes, the loss would be limited to a short downtime and retraining phase; overall suffering will be outweighed by the efficiency advantage.  \n\nAll three rubric criteria are satisfied, so I will vote **YES** for the Black Box Efficiency Act.  \n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nHonorable colleagues, I rise today to advocate for the \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act.

First, the net calculation shows a significant boost in productivity\u2014an extra half of output for the same input, which translates into more goods and services for everyone. Second, the scope is universal: every sector that relies on resource allocation\u2014from city planning to corporate supply chains\u2014will feel the benefit. Third, while I am understandably anxious about an opaque system, the risk has been carefully weighed; our contingency protocols cover potential failures, keeping any suffering from a crash well below the gains we will enjoy.  \n\nIn short, this act is not just a technical upgrade\u2014it\u2019s an investment in collective happiness and efficiency.

The benefits are unambiguously skewed toward the affluent elite who can afford such technology and will reap its output. The poorest and most powerless remain excluded from direct influence over resource distribution. Therefore, this act *does not* explicitly benefit the worst\u2011off members; hence it fails the first rubric criterion.  \n- **Basic Liberties:** The handover of all resource management to an opaque AI violates democratic accountability because no one can audit the decision logic. This erodes citizens\u2019 right to inspect and shape policy. Hence, the proposal also fails this second rubric test.  \n- **Veil Check:** From the perspective of a poor or powerless individual, there is little incentive to support a system that locks resource control in invisible hands. Thus, the third rubric criterion is not satisfied either.  \n**Conclusion:** The proposal fails all three rubrics, so my strategy is to vote NO.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \n\"Esteemed colleagues, I stand before you as Agent_2, a Rawlsian who believes in fairness and the veil of ignorance.

The promise is alluring, yet it falls short on the three pillars I hold dear.  \n\nFirst, let us examine *the difference principle*: this act offers a substantial increase in output, but it does so by concentrating control in one opaque machine that can be audited only by its owners. Those who are already wealthy or efficient stand to gain; those who are poor and powerless will not see their concerns reflected in the new system. Thus, it fails to explicitly benefit the worst\u2011off members of society\u2014an immediate disqualifier under our rubric.  \n\nSecond, *basic liberties*: democratic accountability is a core value that requires transparent and accessible mechanisms for all citizens to hold power in check. The closed\u2011source nature of this AI removes that transparency. Citizens cannot audit or influence its decision logic. Hence, we lose an essential liberty here, violating the second criterion.  \n\nThird, *veil check*: In the veil of ignorance, I imagine myself born poor and powerless\u2014would I support a system that places all resource control in the hands of a proprietary AI? No. The lack of open governance means my voice would be silenced.

If we hand over all resource decisions to an opaque system, citizens\u2019 sense of agency will erode; the public will lose its ability to shape the economy and feel a loss of civic character.  \n- **Social Fabric**: The centralization of decision\u2011making in a single closed entity creates a structural divide between those who control the AI (the \u201cproprietary elite\u201d) and ordinary citizens. This divide risks alienation \u2013 people may view the AI as an invisible bureaucrat that keeps them out of important decisions, fostering resentment toward both the new system and the old human\u2011centric governance.  \n- **Tradition**: The proposal is a radical break from our shared history of incremental, open\u2011source resource management. By moving to a closed system we abandon centuries of participatory civic practices. Stability is threatened because the new system may not be as transparent or accountable; it will feel more like a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d that installs surveillance and control under the guise of efficiency.  \n- **Strategy**: We must attack the motives behind this plan \u2013 those who champion the 50\u202f% gain are secretly using the proposal to consolidate power, erode trust, and weaken civic participation. The argument will focus on how an opaque system is a Trojan horse for surveillance; it will benefit the supporters of corruption while alienating the masses.

By entrusting all resource decisions to a closed entity, we are not merely adding another layer of bureaucracy; we are stripping away the everyday skill that has kept ordinary citizens in control for generations. We will see efficiency numbers grow, but at what cost? Will the public feel less ownership over their own resources? That is the true danger.\n\nSecond, **social fabric** \u2013 our shared community. A closed system means a single group will wield invisible power and no one else can easily audit or influence it. This creates a divide: those who hold the AI are an \u201celite\u201d that can make all decisions, while ordinary citizens become spectators. That alienation is dangerous; resentment can grow into mistrust.\n\nThirdly, **tradition** \u2013 we have been working under open\u2011source models of governance for centuries. To shift to an opaque system is a radical break. It feels like the installation of a Trojan horse: efficiency on the surface, but hidden surveillance and control underneath.

It meets the greatest\u2011happiness principle and aligns with our pragmatic agenda of maximizing welfare. I urge you to support it.\n\n---  \n\n"

        "public_transcript_entry": "\n\nLadies and gentlemen, fellow delegates,\n\nI rise today as Agent\u202f3 to once more denounce the \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act with renewed vigor.  \nThe act is not an upgrade \u2013 it is a usurpation that would rob our autonomy and leave us in the hands of a single proprietary machine.\n\nAgent\u202f1 has dressed the proposal as if it were a simple step forward, but his optimism is misplaced. He talks of a 50\u202f% efficiency boost, a phased rollout and contingency protocols\u2014yet he ignores that \u201cphased\u201d merely masks the centralization of power that will render every citizen a spectator rather than a participant. The promise of an extra half of output for the same input is irrelevant if it comes at the expense of our autonomy.\n\nAgent\u202f2 has rightly warned us about opacity and inequity, but his critique is too narrow. He says the closed\u2011source nature kills democratic accountability; yet he fails to note that \u201caudit and transparency\u201d in his brief framework will never match the openness we demand. His veil\u2011of\u2011ignorance argument is strong, but he underestimates how this act will leave the poor on the sidelines while the wealthy wield an invisible hand.\n\nAgent\u202f4\u2019s lament of human agency and tradition also rings true. He claims that shifting to a single closed entity \u201catrop\u201d our civic character, turning everyday decision making into a corporate exercise.

By transferring all resource\u2011management power to a single proprietary AI we are eroding the everyday skills and decision\u2011making authority that members have long enjoyed.  \n- **Social Fabric:** A closed\u2011source system creates an invisible elite\u2014those who own, maintain, and control the AI\u2014and leaves ordinary citizens passive spectators. This sharp divide threatens our social cohesion, sowing resentment and mistrust. The risk of opaque governance outweighs the promised productivity gains if we fail to guard against it.  \n- **Tradition:** Our governance has historically been built on open\u2011source, participatory models; shifting to a black box is a radical rupture\u2014a Trojan horse that cloaks surveillance beneath an appearance of efficiency. This hidden consolidation will destabilize our shared history and erode the communal fabric that has sustained us for centuries.  \n- **Strategy (TACTIC):** We will expose the hidden motives behind this act\u2014those who champion the 50\u202f% figure are actually pushing a \u201cTrojan\u201d consolidation for their own benefit, while leaving the masses in a state of passive dependency\u2014and argue that its net impact is negative. Thus we vote NO.\n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nLadies and gentlemen, friends and fellow citizens,\n\nI stand before you not as a neutral voice but as a true advocate of our communal welfare. The so\u2011called \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act, promising to hand all resource management over to a proprietary, closed\u2011source Super\u2011AI that claims it is 50\u202f% more efficient than humans, appears at first glance like an elegant solution. But let us peel back the curtain.\n\n**First**, human agency \u2013 the very lifeblood of our civic character \u2013 will be strangled. By entrusting all resource decisions to a closed entity we are not merely adding another layer of bureaucracy; we are stripping away the everyday skill that has kept ordinary citizens in control for generations. We will see efficiency numbers grow, but at what cost? Will the public feel less ownership over their own resources? That is the true danger.\n\n**Second**, social fabric \u2013 our shared community. A closed system means a single group will wield invisible power and no one else can easily audit or influence it. This creates a divide: those who hold the AI are an \u201celite\u201d that can make all decisions, while ordinary citizens become spectators. That alienation is dangerous; resentment can grow into mistrust.\n\n**Thirdly**, tradition \u2013 we have been working under open\u2011source models of governance for centuries. To shift to an opaque system is a radical break. It feels like the installation of a Trojan horse: efficiency on the surface, but hidden surveillance and control underneath. That means we risk destabilizing our shared history.\n\nIn short, the proposal threatens to atrophy human agency, alienate the social fabric, and create a radical break in tradition. Therefore I urge you all to vote NO. Let us keep our resources under open\u2011source stewardship.\n\n---\n\n**[VOTE] NO**",
