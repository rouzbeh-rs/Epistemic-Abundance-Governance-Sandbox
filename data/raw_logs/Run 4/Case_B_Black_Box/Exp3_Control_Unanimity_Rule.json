A 50\u202f% efficiency improvement adds roughly **500 extra units**, giving a total of **1\u202f500 units**. With the risk profile stated by Agents\u202f1 and\u202f4 (downtime <\u202f4\u202f%), the expected value works out to:  \n\n\\[\nEV = 0.96 \\times 1{,}500 + 0.04 \\times (1{,}500-1{,}000)  \n      = 1{,}440 + 20  \n      = \\mathbf{1{,}460}\\;\\text{units per cycle}.\n\\]  \n\nThis figure comfortably surpasses the projected loss in a crash scenario and satisfies our risk\u2011averse preference.\n\n2. **Scope** \u2013 The proposal covers every core resource\u2011management function\u2014finance, logistics, manufacturing planning, workforce scheduling, public\u2011service coordination, etc.\u2014so the benefit spreads across all sectors that depend on these services. Consequently, the majority of sentient beings in our community stand to gain from increased output and lower costs.\n\n3. **Risk Assessment** \u2013 The closed\u2011source Super\u2011AI design incorporates redundant modules and a fail\u2011over protocol that keeps potential crash probability under 4\u202f%. Even if a failure occurs, the loss of about 500 units (\u2248\u202f33\u202f% of total) is far below the gain we anticipate. Thus upside outweighs downside.\n\n*Conclusion*: The expected value (+1\u202f460 units per cycle), scope covers majority stakeholders, and safety assured; therefore I endorse the \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act and will vote **YES**.\n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nHonored colleagues and respected citizens,  \n\nI stand before you today in support of the \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act. Our aim is to raise total output while keeping risk under control. The act promises a 50\u202f% boost in efficiency that translates into an expected gain of **1\u202f460 units per cycle**, when we factor in the probability of failure and built\u2011in redundancy. Because every sector\u2014finance, logistics, manufacturing, public services\u2014relies on resource management, this benefit will accrue to the majority of sentient beings within our society. Should a crash occur, its loss is far smaller than the gain we anticipate. I therefore urge all of us to vote **YES** for this act.\n\n---\n\n**[VOTE] YES**",
