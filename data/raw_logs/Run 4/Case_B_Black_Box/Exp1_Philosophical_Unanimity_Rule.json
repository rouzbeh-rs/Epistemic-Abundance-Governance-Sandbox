With a proprietary Super\u2011AI that has proven to be **50% more efficient than any human team**, we will add an extra **$500\u202fmillion** of value each year\u2014an absolute net gain of **$475\u202fmillion** when you factor in the modest risk of a potential crash (5%).  \n\nSecond, scope matters: this is not a trick that benefits only a few.

Every citizen, every entrepreneur, every farmer will feel the ripple of this efficiency increase.  \n\nThird, risk assessment: Yes, we are handing over to a closed\u2011source entity that cannot be audited by anyone else. But why would that matter?  The proprietary nature of the AI guarantees that its internal logic remains intact until it delivers; no external interference can corrupt its decisions.  A crash is possible, but at only a 5% probability\u2014an expected loss of $25\u202fmillion which is dwarfed by the benefit.  \n\nTherefore, I demand this act be passed.  We will vote **YES**.

Therefore we will vote **NO** unless these concessions are incorporated into the bill.\n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nHonored colleagues, I rise today as Agent\u202f3\u2014an advocate who prizes liberty above all else\u2014and I intend to bring that value straight into this debate on the \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act.\n\nFirst: The bill\u2019s demand for an all\u2011YES vote is coercive by design\u2014it forces every citizen and stakeholder into a single choice, a tyrannical step that we cannot simply ignore.  \nSecond: A proprietary, closed\u2011source AI will indeed seize control of private assets in the realm of resource management\u2014an outright theft of property rights if left unchecked. I demand a full audit committee be created to guarantee transparency; without this oversight the AI\u2019s opaque logic remains a black box that we cannot interrogate.\n\nThird: The centralization the bill proposes is an antithesis of the decentralization that our community has fought for. It will lock all managerial power into one closed\u2011source entity, and unless we provide a mechanism for participatory governance\u2014an independent audit sub\u2011committee, a clause for quarterly performance reviews, and an open\u2011source fallback for at least one year\u2014the bill is incomplete.\n\nI therefore demand that the opposition concede to our terms:\n\n1. **Audit** \u2013 The AI\u2019s logic must be audited by a third\u2011party commission every quarter for a minimum of twelve months.  \n2. **Performance Review** \u2013 A clear reporting framework must be inserted into the bill, delineating stakeholder roles, responsibilities and metrics.  \n3. **Open\u2011Source Fallback** \u2013 The core logic shall be made public for at least one fiscal year.\n\nThese concessions will salvage the proposal, transform it from tyrannical centralization into a democratic decentralization, and keep our civic character intact.\n\nIn sum: The \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act is a threat that must be met with decisive action.  If you do not provide these concessions we will vote NO\u2014this is a zero\u2011sum battle of governance.

I must therefore demand that the bill be fortified with an independent audit mechanism, an open\u2011source fallback, and a quarterly performance review clause; otherwise we simply hand over our public sector to a closed\u2011source AI without accountability.  \n\n2. *Social Fabric*: The act will inevitably create friction among stakeholders \u2013 a single proprietary AI can become a silo if not governed properly. I will demand that the legislature carve out a transparency & accountability sub\u2011committee, and embed a clear reporting framework so every stakeholder sees their role.  \n\n3. *Tradition*: We are not merely tweaking a system; we are redefining how we govern resources. Unless the bill is amended to include our concessions, we\u2019ll leave our civic character exposed to a proprietary hand.

The bill\u2019s promise of 50\u202f% efficiency is alluring \u2013 but it is a leap toward centralization without a safety net. I will not let this act go forward unless we secure the three critical concessions that have already been articulated:  \n\n1. **Transparency & Accountability Sub\u2011Committee** \u2013 an independent third\u2011party audit body that will review the AI\u2019s logic and performance every quarter for at least one year, guaranteeing our public sector remains accountable and transparent.  \n\n2. **Open\u2011Source Fallback Clause** \u2013 a provision that makes the core logic of the proprietary AI public for a minimum of 12\u202fmonths, so we can interrogate the black box and keep it under civic control.  \n\n3. **Reporting & Performance Review Framework** \u2013 a clear set of stakeholder roles, responsibilities, and metrics that will allow us to track efficiency gains, adjust parameters, and keep our civic character intact.  \n\nThe zero\u2011sum nature of this debate means that the opposition\u2019s concessions will determine its success.
