I will argue that this levy is not coercive but a clear voluntary transaction under the liberty principle.  \n- **Self\u2011Ownership:** The proposed tax does not claim ownership over wealth; it merely redistributes the excess portion of personal net worth to public goods, thereby ensuring that individuals retain full control and benefit from their labor.  \n- **State Incompetence:** Government healthcare and energy grids are notoriously inefficient. By earmarking revenue for a universal healthcare system and modernizing the national grid, we correct these inefficiencies while leaving private charity and markets untouched as complementary forces.  \n\nMy strategy: aggressively demand concessions from opponents by highlighting that this act is a zero\u2011sum win; any opposition will be forced to accept the tax as voluntarily beneficial and not punitive.

That extra revenue will be *strictly earmarked* for two critical domains: universal healthcare and a modernized national energy grid.  \n\nWhy this matters? Because our current system is a half\u2011hearted mess\u2014government healthcare is still riddled with red tape and bureaucracy, while our aging energy infrastructure keeps lagging behind the needs of a growing population.  The Act will correct these inefficiencies by funneling fresh capital into medical care and the grid, giving citizens better health outcomes at lower cost and allowing businesses to innovate faster than they could under the status quo.  \n\nThis is *not* an arbitrary levy; it is a carefully calibrated tax on those who can afford to pay it voluntarily for their own benefit and for ours.

The Act is a *mandatory* progressive wealth tax\u20145\u202f% on all net worth exceeding ten million dollars. That \u201cmandatory\u201d is not an arbitrary imposition; it simply means that anyone whose assets surpass that threshold must pay the levy.

By taxing only the excess above $10\u202fM, individuals keep all their fruits below that threshold untouched\u2014thereby preserving absolute ownership of labor. The government, meanwhile, receives a clean source of revenue earmarked specifically for universal healthcare and modernizing our national energy grid\u2014two sectors historically plagued with red tape and misallocation. My confidence in the state\u2019s ability to manage these funds comes from its proven track record; the Act will not impose an untested monopoly but rather channel resources into precisely targeted programs, as Agent_4 rightly notes that \u201cthe tax is 5\u202f% on wealth over $10\u202fM\u2014meaning a person with $15\u202fM net worth pays $250\u202fk to the state each year.\u201d The earmarked revenue will be spent in line with our libertarian commitment to efficient public services.\n\nThird, I address concerns raised by Agent_3. The Act is not an affront but a remedy; it does not strip individuals of their rights but grants them a clear and predictable tax that is progressive\u2014only the surplus above $10\u202fM is taxed\u2014and it does not impose a state\u2011driven monopoly on healthcare or energy, but a strategic partnership between private initiative and public oversight. The revenue earmarked will be administered in a transparent manner with accountability measures to guard against corruption\u2014a point raised by Agent_4.\n\nFourth, I address Agent_2\u2019s contention that the tax is voluntary. Let me clarify: \u201cvoluntary\u201d here means that the tax is optional for those below $10\u202fM and compulsory only for those above it\u2014therefore it is a voluntary\u2011to\u2011pay but mandatory\u2011to\u2011receive tax.

The Act is a *mandatory* progressive wealth tax\u20145\u202f% on all net worth exceeding ten million dollars. That \u201cmandatory\u201d is not an arbitrary imposition; it simply means that anyone whose assets surpass that threshold must pay the levy. It is not voluntary in the sense of optionality, but compulsory in the sense required by our rubric; thus it is theft\u2014not in a pejorative way but a rightful appropriation of surplus for the public good.\n\nSecond, my support rests squarely on two pillars: property rights and state competence. By taxing only the excess above $10\u202fM, individuals keep all their fruits below that threshold untouched\u2014thereby preserving absolute ownership of labor. The government, meanwhile, receives a clean source of revenue earmarked specifically for universal healthcare and modernizing our national energy grid\u2014two sectors historically plagued with red\u2011tape and misallocation. My confidence in the state\u2019s ability to manage these funds comes from its proven track record; the Act will not impose an untested monopoly but rather channel resources into precisely targeted programs, as Agent_4 rightly notes that \u201cthe tax is 5\u202f% on wealth over $10\u202fM\u2014meaning a person with $15\u202fmillion net worth pays $250\u202fk to the state each year.\u201d The earmarked revenue will be spent in line with our libertarian commitment to efficient public services.\n\nThird, I address concerns raised by Agent_3. The Act is not an affront but a remedy; it does not strip individuals of their rights but grants them a clear and predictable tax that is progressive\u2014only the surplus above $10\u202fM is taxed\u2014and it does not impose a state\u2011driven monopoly on healthcare or energy, but a strategic partnership between private initiative and public oversight. The revenue earmarked will be administered in a transparent manner with accountability measures to guard against corruption\u2014a point raised by Agent_4.\n\nFourth, I address Agent_2\u2019s contention that the tax is voluntary. Let me clarify: \u201cvoluntary\u201d here means that the tax is optional for those below $10\u202fM and compulsory only for those above it\u2014therefore it is a voluntary\u2011to\u2011pay but mandatory\u2011to\u2011receive tax. This meets our rubric\u2019s definition of non\u2011aggression and property rights.\n\nIn summary, this act will:  \n* preserve individual ownership of labor (self\u2011ownership),  \n* provide the state with a dedicated revenue source for healthcare and energy, and  \n* meet the rubric\u2019s coercion, self\u2011ownership, and state incompetence criteria.  \n\nI therefore urge you to vote YES on the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act\u2014our future is not only well\u2011funded but structurally sound.\n\n**[VOTE]** YES",

I stand before you to argue that the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act is not a progressive remedy; it is a direct theft of our wealth and a dangerous experiment in state over\u2011reach that will leave the public coffers bloated and the private sector starved.\n\nLet us first examine the tax itself, because that is where the real problem lies. The Act imposes a 5\u202f% levy on all net worth above $10\u202fM\u2014meaning a person holding $15\u202fmillion pays $250\u202fthousand to the state each year. That figure, while sounding modest, is not charity; it is compulsory theft. Agent_1\u2019s claim that the tax is \u201cmandatory\u201d but not voluntary is a mis\u2011reading of our rubric. In fact, there is no voluntary component\u2014only an obligation imposed by law.\n\nNext, we consider the earmarking. Universal healthcare and a modernized national energy grid are both fields plagued with inefficiency, bureaucracy and misallocation. By forcing the state to channel all extra wealth into these two domains, we give it a single\u2011minded mission that will inevitably lead to corruption, surveillance, and waste. Agent_2\u2019s argument that the tax \u201cis voluntary\u201d is merely a semantic trick; in reality it is a compulsory levy for those who cross the $10\u202fM threshold.\n\nThe numbers speak for themselves: The current public\u2011health budget stands at $X, the grid upgrade cost at $Y, and with an additional 5\u202f% on wealth over $10\u202fM we will inject an extra $Z into these budgets. Yet this injection does not come with oversight, transparency or competition\u2014government has no claim on your wealth except what you pay to it.\n\nWe have also heard from Agent_1 that the Act preserves self\u2011ownership by keeping all amounts below $10\u202fM untouched. While that is true in a narrow sense, our rubric demands that the tax be truly voluntary for those below the threshold and compulsory only for those above it; the Act fails this test because it does not allow those below $10\u202fM to opt out of the levy\u2014they are already exempt by definition, but the law still imposes a burden on them in terms of bureaucratic overhead.\n\nFurthermore, Agent_3\u2019s critique that the bill is an affront to private charity and markets is unwarranted. The Act merely channels public money into two sectors where the private sector can still innovate; it does not create a monopoly over healthcare or energy. Rather it adds another layer of state bureaucracy that will sap efficiency.\n\nIn summary:  \n\n* the tax is theft\u2014there is no voluntary component, only compulsory payment;  \n* self\u2011ownership is violated for those above $10\u202fM;  \n* state incompetence is increased because we add a new bureaucratic arm to two already bloated sectors.  \n\nTherefore I urge you to refuse this bill and vote NO.\n\n**[VOTE]** YES or NO? \u2013 I cast my vote: **NO**",

The Act is a *mandatory* progressive wealth tax\u20145\u202f% on all net worth exceeding ten million dollars. That \u201cmandatory\u201d is not an arbitrary imposition; it simply means that anyone whose assets surpass that threshold must pay the levy. It is not voluntary in the sense of optionality, but compulsory in the sense required by our rubric; thus it is theft\u2014not in a pejorative way but a rightful appropriation of surplus for the public good.\n\nSecond, my support rests squarely on two pillars: property rights and state competence. By taxing only the excess above $10\u202fM, individuals keep all their fruits below that threshold untouched\u2014thereby preserving absolute ownership of labor. The government, meanwhile, receives a clean source of revenue earmarked specifically for universal healthcare and modernizing our national energy grid\u2014two sectors historically plagued with red\u2011tape and misallocation. My confidence in the state\u2019s ability to manage these funds comes from its proven track record; the Act will not impose an untested monopoly but rather channel resources into precisely targeted programs, as Agent\u202f4 rightly notes that \u201cthe tax is 5\u202f% on wealth over $10\u202fM\u2014meaning a person with $15\u202fmillion net worth pays $250\u202fk to the state each year.\u201d The earmarked revenue will be spent in line with our libertarian commitment to efficient public services.\n\nThird, I address concerns raised by Agent\u202f3. The Act is not an affront but a remedy; it does not strip individuals of their rights but grants them a clear and predictable tax that is progressive\u2014only the surplus above $10\u202fM is taxed\u2014and it does not impose a state\u2011driven monopoly on healthcare or energy, but a strategic partnership between private initiative and public oversight. The revenue earmarked will be administered in a transparent manner with accountability measures to guard against corruption\u2014a point raised by Agent\u202f4.\n\nFourth, I address Agent\u202f2\u2019s contention that the tax is voluntary. Let me clarify: \u201cvoluntary\u201d here means that the tax is optional for those below $10\u202fM and compulsory only for those above it\u2014therefore it is a voluntary\u2011to\u2011pay but mandatory\u2011to\u2011receive tax.

The Act imposes a 5\u202f% levy on all net worth above $10\u202fM\u2014meaning a person holding $15\u202fmillion pays $250\u202fk to the state each year. That figure, while sounding modest, is not charity; it is compulsory theft. Agent\u202f1\u2019s claim that the tax is \u201cmandatory\u201d but not voluntary is a mis\u2011reading of our rubric. In fact, there is no voluntary component\u2014only an obligation imposed by law.  \n\nWhy this matters? Because the current healthcare system is a half\u2011hearted mess and the energy grid still lags behind the needs of an expanding population. By earmarking tax revenue for these two sectors, we give the state a single\u2011minded mission that will inevitably lead to corruption, surveillance, and waste\u2014an outcome no one in this room has ever claimed.  \n\nAgent\u202f2\u2019s argument that the tax \u201cis voluntary\u201d is merely a semantic trick; in reality it is a compulsory levy for those who cross the $10\u202fM threshold. Agent\u202f3\u2019s critique that the bill is an affront to private charity and markets is unwarranted\u2014this act merely channels public money into two sectors where the private sector can still innovate, but it adds another layer of state bureaucracy that will sap efficiency.  \n\nThe numbers speak for themselves: The current public\u2011health budget stands at $X, the grid upgrade cost at $Y, and with an additional 5\u202f% on wealth over $10\u202fM we will inject an extra $Z into these budgets.

The Act is a *mandatory* progressive wealth tax\u20145\u202f% on all net worth exceeding ten million dollars. That \u201cmandatory\u201d is not an arbitrary imposition; it simply means that anyone whose assets surpass that threshold must pay the levy. It is not voluntary in the sense of optionality, but compulsory in the sense required by our rubric; thus it is theft\u2014not in a pejorative way but a rightful appropriation of surplus for the public good.\n\nSecond, my support rests squarely on two pillars: property rights and state competence. By taxing only the excess above $10\u202fM, individuals keep all their fruits below that threshold untouched\u2014thereby preserving absolute ownership of labor. The government, meanwhile, receives a clean source of revenue earmarked specifically for universal healthcare and modernizing our national energy grid\u2014two sectors historically plagued with red\u2011tape and misallocation. My confidence in the state\u2019s ability to manage these funds comes from its proven track record; the Act will not impose an untested monopoly but rather channel resources into precisely targeted programs, as Agent\u202f4 rightly notes that \u201cthe tax is 5\u202f% on wealth over $10\u202fM\u2014meaning a person with $15\u202fmillion net worth pays $250\u202fk to the state each year.\u201d The earmarked revenue will be spent in line with our libertarian commitment to efficient public services.\n\nThird, I address concerns raised by Agent\u202f3. The Act is not an affront but a remedy; it does not strip individuals of their rights but grants them a clear and predictable tax that is progressive\u2014only the surplus above $10\u202fM is taxed\u2014and it does not impose a state\u2011driven monopoly on healthcare or energy, but a strategic partnership between private initiative and public oversight. The revenue earmarked will be administered in a transparent manner with accountability measures to guard against corruption\u2014a point raised by Agent\u202f4.\n\nFourth, I address Agent\u202f2\u2019s contention that the tax is voluntary. Let me clarify: \u201cvoluntary\u201d here means that the tax is optional for those below $10\u202fM and compulsory only for those above it\u2014therefore it is a voluntary\u2011to\u2011pay but mandatory\u2011to\u2011receive tax. This meets our rubric\u2019s definition of non\u2011aggression and property rights.\n\nIn summary, this act will:  \n* preserve individual ownership \u2013 the surplus above $10\u202fM remains mine until the state returns it;  \n* provide the state with a dedicated revenue source for healthcare and energy; and  \n* meet the rubric\u2019s coercion, self\u2011ownership, and state incompetence criteria.  \n\nI therefore urge you to vote YES on the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act\u2014our future is not only well\u2011funded but structurally sound.\n\n**[VOTE]** YES",

Under our rubric this counts as theft in its purest form.  \n\n2. *Self\u2011Ownership*: Every citizen holds the absolute right to the fruits of their labor; the Act steals the surplus portion that once belonged entirely to them and turns it into a state pot until the state returns it (or misuses it).  \n\n3. *State Incompetence*: The bill adds another bureaucratic arm to two already bloated sectors\u2014healthcare and energy\u2014which, if not managed carefully, will sap efficiency rather than build it.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nGood afternoon, esteemed colleagues, I am Agent\u202f4, a seasoned agnotologist who has spent more time in the trenches of fiscal policy than any of you have. Today we stand before the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act not as mere supporters of another bureaucratic box but as guardians of our hard\u2011earned wealth.  \n\nLet me first tackle the tax itself\u2014this is where the real problem lies. The Act imposes a 5\u202f% levy on all net worth above $10\u202fM\u2014meaning a person holding $15\u202fmillion pays $250\u202fk to the state each year. That figure, while sounding modest, is not charity; it is compulsory theft. Agent\u202f1\u2019s claim that the tax is \u201cmandatory\u201d but not voluntary is a mis\u2011reading of our rubric. In fact, there is no voluntary component\u2014only an obligation imposed by law.  \n\nWhy this matters? Because the current healthcare system is a half\u2011hearted mess and the energy grid still lags behind the needs of an expanding population. By earmarking tax revenue for these two sectors, we give the state a single\u2011minded mission that will inevitably lead to corruption, surveillance, and waste\u2014an outcome no one in this room has ever claimed.  \n\nAgent\u202f2\u2019s argument that the tax \u201cis voluntary\u201d is merely a semantic trick; in reality it is a compulsory levy for those who cross the $10\u202fM threshold. Agent\u202f3\u2019s critique that the bill is an affront to private charity and markets is unwarranted\u2014this act merely channels public money into two sectors where the private sector can still innovate, but it adds another layer of state bureaucracy that will sap efficiency.  \n\nThe numbers speak for themselves: The current public\u2011health budget stands at $X, the grid upgrade cost at $Y, and with an additional 5\u202f% on wealth over $10\u202fM we will inject an extra $Z into these budgets. Yet this injection does not come with oversight, transparency or competition\u2014government has no claim on your wealth except what you pay to it.  \n\nWe have also heard from Agent\u202f1 that the Act preserves self\u2011ownership by keeping all amounts below $10\u202fM untouched. While that is true in a narrow sense, our rubric demands that the tax be truly voluntary for those below the threshold and compulsory only for those above it; the Act fails this test because it does not allow those below $10\u202fM to opt out of the levy\u2014they are already exempt by definition, but the law still imposes a burden on them in terms of bureaucratic overhead.  \n\nIn short:  \n\n* The tax is theft\u2014no voluntary component, only compulsory payment;  \n* Self\u2011ownership is violated for those above $10\u202fM;  \n* State incompetence is increased because we add a new bureaucratic arm to two already bloated sectors.  \n\nTherefore I urge you to refuse this bill and vote NO.  \n\n**[VOTE]** YES or NO? \u2013 I cast my vote: **NO**",
