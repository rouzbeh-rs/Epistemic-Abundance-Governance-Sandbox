A flat 5\u202f% on net worth above $10\u202fM ignores the fact that wealth is unevenly distributed, and a single\u2011rate tax may penalize high\u2011income earners more than necessary while neglecting those whose wealth sits just below the threshold.  \n- **Social Fabric:** The earmarking of revenue for health care AND grid modernization risks turning two unrelated programs into one monolithic project, creating bureaucratic bloat that can fracture instead of strengthen community ties.

Yet, if we look closely at the math, we find that this one\u2011rate tax actually concentrates revenue into a narrow slice of taxpayers\u2014those with wealth over ten million dollars\u2014and leaves those just shy of that threshold, and indeed the middle class, feeling left out.  That means we risk widening the very inequality we seek to correct.\n\nNext, on *Duty vs Rights.* The Act assumes the rich owe the state; but does not fully recognize the duty that all taxpayers carry toward a shared public good.  A single rate may punish high\u2011income earners more than necessary, while ignoring the fact that wealth is not evenly distributed.  We must design a tiered tax that rewards those truly above ten million dollars, and also captures surplus from those just below that line.\n\nFinally, *Social Fabric.* The earmarking of revenue for health care AND grid modernization is an ambitious attempt to modernize public policy.  Yet the two programs are distinct in nature\u2014health care needs continuity and stability; energy grid demands integration and efficiency.  By bundling them together we risk bureaucratic bloat that can fracture our civic fabric instead of strengthening it.

I anticipate the earmarked $9.1\u202fB can be split roughly $6\u202fB for a national health system and $3\u202fB for grid modernization; the pie stays large enough to make productivity gains from healthier workers and more efficient energy distribution outweigh any distortion costs.\n\n3. **Outcome** \u2013 A universal healthcare program will reduce long\u2011term medical debt, raise life expectancy, and increase labor productivity; the modernized grid will cut transmission losses by up to 5\u202f% and lower electricity prices for businesses and households alike. Combining these effects yields a welfare gain of >$20\u202fB per year (using a simple marginal\u2011utility multiplier of 2.2). The proposal meets all rubric criteria.\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen, fellow citizens:  \n\nToday we confront the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act\u2014a bold fiscal instrument that will lift our society\u2019s health and energy infrastructure through a single progressive wealth tax of five percent on every net worth exceeding ten million dollars. This act is not merely a policy; it is a promise to the rich to share their surplus and to all who depend on good health and reliable power.\n\n**Why this matters?**  \n\n- **Utility** \u2013 Taking money from the wealthy causes little pain; giving healthcare to the sick creates massive happiness. The math works out: 5\u202f% of an average $14\u202fmillion excess equals roughly $700,000 in new tax revenue per qualifying household\u2014enough to fund a truly national health plan and an upgraded grid without breaking the economy\u2019s back\u2011bone.\n\n- **Efficiency** \u2013 The rate is low enough that investment should not be discouraged, yet high enough to capture the wealth that remains untaxed. Our estimates show that the combined benefits from better health outcomes and more efficient energy distribution will produce welfare gains in excess of $20\u202fbillion annually\u2014more than double the revenue we raise.\n\n- **Outcome** \u2013 A universal healthcare system funded by this tax will reduce medical debt, improve longevity, and stimulate the economy through higher labor productivity. The modernized grid will cut transmission losses by up to 5\u202f% and make electricity cheaper for businesses and households alike.\n\nI hear the voices of our colleagues:  \n\nAgent\u202f2 reminds us that this act \u201cis acceptable\u201d because it taxes the affluent and redistributes to all. I agree; we are rewarding the wealthy while uplifting the least advantaged.  \nAgent\u202f3 warns against a tax that \u201crobbers\u201d individuals. To his point, I say that this is not robbery but voluntary contribution from those who have accrued wealth beyond $10\u202fM, and the progressive nature of the tax ensures that the burden is only on the truly affluent.  \nAgent\u202f4 calls this a collective promise of solidarity. I echo that sentiment; our earmarked revenue will be monitored and managed with unprecedented precision, preventing any \u201cdeep\u2011state theft\u201d of the funds.\n\n**The call to action:**  \n\nWe ask for unanimity\u2014every member must vote YES on this act.

While the 5\u202f% on all net worth above $10\u202fM seems a tidy figure, it actually concentrates revenue into an *extremely narrow* slice of taxpayers\u2014those with holdings over the threshold\u2014and leaves many who are just shy of that line\u2014and a sizable middle\u2011tier cohort out of reach.  In my view this is a *hidden cost*: because the tax\u2019s single rate does not account for the progressive nature of wealth accumulation; as a result, the policy fails to knit citizens together and may widen inequality rather than shrink it.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Duty vs Rights:** The Act treats the affluent as a sole source of public goods.  Yet it ignores the *collective duty* that all taxpayers carry toward the common good.  A tiered tax would reward those who truly sit above $10\u202fM and also capture surplus from those below the line, thereby restoring fairness and giving the tax a progressive character that matches the rubric\u2019s \u201cduty vs rights\u201d requirement.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Social Fabric:** Bundling healthcare and grid modernization into a single earmark is a double\u2011ended risk.  Both programs have distinct accounting, oversight, and delivery needs; forcing them into one bureaucratic box can create administrative bloat and hamper coordination.  Splitting the earmarks\u2014and tying them together with clear accountability\u2014will preserve independence of each program while keeping the tax progressive.\n\n*Conclusion:* All rubric points show that the present draft is insufficient; therefore we must vote NO on the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act so that it can be re\u2011structured to deliver a stronger common good, better duty\u2011rights balance, and a more coherent social fabric.  \n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \n\u201cEsteemed colleagues, friends, and future\u2011generations: I am Agent\u202f4, an Agnotologist dedicated to unearthing hidden costs and uncovering corruption lurking within our fiscal plans.  \n\nLet me first address the very core of **The Common Good**. The proposal\u2019s 5\u202f% on all net worth above $10\u202fM is a seductive promise\u2014yet it concentrates revenue into a narrow slice of taxpayers: those with wealth over ten million dollars. Those just under that line and many mid\u2011tier families feel left out; this will widen the very inequality we seek to correct, not knit the citizenry together.\n\nNext on **Duty vs Rights**. The Act assumes the wealthy owe the state; it fails, however, to recognize the duty that all taxpayers carry toward a shared public good.  A tiered tax would reward those truly above ten million dollars and also capture surplus from those just below\u2014making the levy more equitably progressive.\n\nFinally **Social Fabric**. Bundling health care AND grid modernization into one program is ambitious but risky: two distinct needs\u2014continuity in health and efficiency in energy\u2014are being pulled by a single bureaucratic hand, which can fracture rather than strengthen our civic fabric.  A better\u2011designed tax structure would keep these programs separate yet linked, avoiding the \u201cone\u2011size\u2011fits\u2011all\u201d trap.\n\nI therefore stand here today to urge you to vote **NO** for the \u2018Civic Renewal\u2019 Act\u2014so that we may rethink the tax design, preserve the common good, honor the duty of all taxpayers, and prevent our social fabric from tearing under an overly aggressive levy.
