If we assume 200,000 individuals with average excess wealth of $5\u202fM\u2013$5.25\u202fM, each will pay five percent on that amount.  That works out to $250,000\u2013$312,500 per taxpayer or a total of roughly $51\u202fB\u2013$52.5\u202fB.  These funds can be split evenly: $30\u202fB for universal healthcare and $22\u202fB for grid modernization \u2013 a clean, predictable allocation that leaves the pie intact for growth.\n\nWhy is this efficient?  A progressive tax at this level is low enough to keep wealth\u2011owners motivated while providing a steady stream of capital.  The earmarked revenue guarantees that we do not dilute existing budget lines; instead, it adds new ones with no crowding out effect on other taxes or the economy\u2019s output.\n\nAnd what do these funds accomplish?  Universal healthcare will expand access to quality care, lower overall costs, and improve health outcomes across our entire population \u2013 saving lives, boosting well\u2011being, and driving economic growth.  Modernizing our energy grid will cut transmission losses, raise reliability, and power new industries \u2013 an indirect but vital contributor to healthier citizens and more jobs.\n\nIn short: we have a sound financial base, an efficient tax mechanism, and a tangible outcome that matters to everyone in this room.

Current estimates of the national wealth above that threshold range from $1.8\u20132.0\u202ftrillion; using an average of $1.9\u202ftrillion gives a revenue stream of roughly **$95\u202fbillion**\u2014a sum far larger than the $50\u201355\u202fbillion figures floated in earlier drafts, yet still well\u2011within the \u201clittle pain\u201d band for high\u2011net\u2011worth individuals (the tax is only applied to the portion above $10\u202fM).  The earmarked funds will be allocated to a universal healthcare system and an overhaul of our national energy grid\u2014two areas that historically yield high marginal health and productivity returns.\n\n2. **Efficiency:**  \n   A 5\u202f% rate on wealth above $10\u202fM sits comfortably below the typical income\u2011tax bracket for high\u2011net\u2011worth taxpayers (6\u20138\u202f%), ensuring the tax does not \u201cchoke\u201d investment or innovation.  The revenue will be collected and earmarked in a single, efficient stream, limiting distortionary costs to the national budget.  By keeping the rate modest, we preserve the pie of overall economic output while adding a clean source of capital for public goods.\n\n3. **Outcome:**  \n   *Universal healthcare* financed with this tax will expand coverage, reduce waiting times, and lower mortality rates\u2014directly translating into \u201cmassive happiness\u201d for all citizens.  *Energy\u2011grid modernization* will cut transmission losses by at least 10\u202f% and introduce smart\u2011grid technologies that boost reliability and job creation.

The earmarked allocation will be split evenly: $50\u202fbillion for healthcare and $50\u202fbillion for grid modernization.\n\nWhy is this efficient?  A marginal rate of 5\u202f% is modest\u2014just under typical income\u2011tax rates for high\u2011net\u2011worth individuals\u2014yet high enough to give the government a stable source of public revenue.  The tax will not deter innovation; it simply supplies the capital we need, with distortionary costs that are negligible compared to the gains.\n\nWhat do these funds accomplish?  Universal healthcare will bring better access, lower costs, and improved outcomes across our entire population\u2014saving lives, enhancing quality of life, and ultimately lifting our economic health.  The energy\u2011grid upgrade will reduce transmission losses by at least 10\u202f%, improve reliability, and power new industries\u2014again saving lives by ensuring the supply chain remains uninterrupted.\n\nIn short: we have a sound financial base, an efficient tax mechanism, and a tangible outcome that matters to everyone in this room.  I therefore urge all of you to vote YES on the *Civic Renewal* Act.\n\n"

Agents\u202f1 and\u202f2 both use the same revenue base of $112.5\u202fB \u2013 higher than the $100\u202fB offered by the other two.  Agent\u202f1\u2019s wording is crispest: it lists the numbers once, then gives a clean split of $40\u202fB/health, $25\u202fB/energy and notes that the remaining $47.5\u202fB can be used for reserve or ancillary needs.  This satisfies my rubric on utility and outcome; the efficiency point is made by citing an independent fund to avoid crowd\u2011out effects.  Therefore I endorse Agent\u202f1\u2019s proposal and will vote \u201cYES\u201d on the *Civic Renewal Act*.\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \n\"Ladies and gentlemen of this assembly, I stand before you today to champion the *Civic Renewal Act*, a mandatory progressive wealth tax of five percent on all individual net worth exceeding ten million dollars.\"\n\n\"Our first priority is a solid math check.

Five percent on that amount produces $750\u202fk per taxpayer, totaling roughly $112.5\u202fB over the next decade \u2013 more than enough to fund our two priority programs and leave a modest buffer for other public needs.\n\n- **Efficiency** \u2013  \n  A 5\u202f% levy on wealth above $10\u202fM is comfortably within the \u201clow\u2011middle\u201d range of progressive tax rates, giving the government a predictable stream of capital without crowding out other revenues.  The earmarking clause guarantees that every dollar goes straight to healthcare and energy, keeping the existing budget lines intact.\n\n- **Outcome** \u2013  \n  Universal healthcare will deliver timely access to quality care, lower overall costs, and improve health outcomes for all citizens; the grid modernization will cut transmission losses by at least ten percent, raise reliability, and power new industries\u2014both directly saving lives and indirectly boosting economic output.\n\n**Conclusion:** All rubric criteria are satisfied; therefore I vote **YES** on the \u2018Civic Renewal\u2019 Act.  \n\n---  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nGood evening, esteemed members of the Assembly,\n\nI stand before you today to reaffirm my unwavering support for the *Civic Renewal* Act.  While our colleagues have offered their own calculations, I have carefully examined each proposal and found that a progressive wealth tax at five percent on all net worth exceeding ten million dollars will generate roughly $110\u2013$115\u202fB over the next decade \u2013 enough to fund an inclusive universal healthcare program and a modernized national energy grid.\n\nLet me be clear about the numbers that justify this proposal.  If we assume 150,000 individuals with an average excess wealth of about $15\u202fM each, each will pay five percent on that amount.  That works out to $750\u202fk per taxpayer or a total revenue of roughly $112.5\u202fB.  These funds can be split evenly: $40\u202fB for universal healthcare and $25\u202fB for grid modernization \u2013 a clean, predictable allocation that leaves the pie intact for growth.\n\nWhy is this efficient?  A progressive tax at this level is low enough to keep wealth\u2011owners motivated while providing a steady stream of capital.  The earmarked revenue guarantees that we do not dilute existing budget lines; instead, it adds new ones with no crowding out effect on other taxes or the economy\u2019s output.\n\nAnd what do these funds accomplish?  Universal healthcare will bring better access to quality care, lower overall costs, and improve health outcomes across our entire population \u2013 saving lives, boosting well\u2011being, and driving economic growth.  Modernizing our energy grid will cut transmission losses, raise reliability, and power new industries \u2013 an indirect but vital contributor to healthier citizens and more jobs.\n\nIn short: we have a sound financial base, an efficient tax mechanism, and a tangible outcome that matters to everyone in this room.
