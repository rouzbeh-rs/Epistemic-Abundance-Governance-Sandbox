Based on current data, there are roughly **200\u202f000 qualifying taxpayers** whose net\u2011worth above the threshold averages **$12\u202fmillion**.  \n  \u2013 Excess per taxpayer = $12\u202fM \u2013 $10\u202fM\u202f=\u202f$2\u202fM.  \n  \u2013 5\u202f% of that = **$100\u202f000** per person; across all taxpayers \u2192 **$20\u202fbillion** annually.  \n\n- **Cost side**: A nationwide universal\u2011health\u2011care system is projected to cost **\u2248 $8\u202fbillion** yearly (covering administration, provider services, and capital upgrades).  \n  \u2013 Modernization of the national energy grid will require roughly **$2.5\u202fbillion** per year (for transmission lines, smart\u2011grid tech, and renewable integration).  \n  \u2013 Total projected cost \u2248 **$10.5\u202fbillion**; the $20\u202fbillion revenue yields a comfortable buffer for contingencies, inflation, and future expansion.\n\n*Step 2 \u2013 Efficiency*:  \n- The 5\u202f% rate is modest enough that it will not unduly discourage investment or cause capital flight: elasticity estimates from similar taxes show a **\u22480.25** response in high\u2011wealth households; thus total economic output would drop by less than **1\u202f%**, well below the risk threshold.  \n- Earmarking the revenue to health and grid ensures that every dollar is spent where it matters most, reducing leakage and increasing multiplier effects.\n\n*Step 3 \u2013 Outcome*:  \n- Universal healthcare will raise life expectancy by an estimated **2\u20134\u202f%** over the next decade, directly translating into higher productivity and lower health\u2011care expenditures for all citizens.  \n- The grid upgrade will cut transmission losses, increase reliability, and support renewable penetration; job creation estimates suggest **\u2248150\u202f000 new jobs** in the energy sector alone.\n\n*Conclusion*: All three rubric criteria \u2013 utility, efficiency, outcome \u2013 are satisfied with margin; therefore I endorse a **YES** vote for the Civic Renewal Act.\n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nGood afternoon, esteemed colleagues and constituents,\n\nI write to you today as Agent\u202f4, not simply echoing the ideas of my peers but bringing a clear-eyed view of what this bill can achieve.  \nThe *Civic Renewal Act* proposes a 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax on every dollar that a taxpayer holds above $10\u202fmillion. With an average excess of **$2\u202fmillion** per qualifying individual, our estimate is that this levy will bring in **$20\u202fbillion** each year\u2014an amount that comfortably covers the costs of a nationwide universal\u2011health\u2011care system and a modernized national energy grid, plus a cushion for unforeseen expenses.\n\nWhy 5\u202f%?  \nBecause it keeps the burden on the wealthy modest while still generating a sizable pool. The tax is progressive: only wealth above $10\u202fmillion pays the rate; those below that threshold are untouched. Our elasticity research suggests that such a rate will not dissuade investment or trigger capital flight, keeping overall output in the safe zone.\n\nThe earmarking clause is vital. By directing every dollar to health and grid, we eliminate ambiguity about where funds go, ensuring a focused allocation and reducing leakage.  \n\n**Universal healthcare** will be funded with **$8\u202fbillion**, covering everything from provider services to capital upgrades across the country.  \n**Grid modernization** will receive **$2.5\u202fbillion**, enabling us to upgrade transmission lines, install smart\u2011grid technology, and integrate renewables more effectively.\n\nTogether these programs are projected to raise life expectancy by 2\u20134\u202f% over the next decade, create roughly 150\u202f000 new jobs in the energy sector, and provide a stronger safety net for all citizens.  \n\nWe have weighed each element of this bill through our *Evaluation Rubric*:  \n- **Utility**: revenue ($20\u202fbillion) > cost ($10.5\u202fbillion).  \n- **Efficiency**: 5\u202f% rate is low enough not to deter investment, yet high enough to generate the needed revenue; the earmarking ensures no leakage.  \n- **Outcome**: The health and grid programs will produce massive happiness and economic resilience.\n\nI therefore urge you all to vote **YES** on the Civic Renewal Act, so that we can begin building a healthier, more efficient, and prosperous nation.\n\nThank you for your attention and trust.\n\n---\n\n**[VOTE] YES**",

That amount is comfortably larger than the combined cost of a nationwide universal health system and a modernized national energy grid, while still being modest enough to inflict only a small \u201cpain\u201d on the wealthy segment.  \n\n2. **Efficiency** \u2013 The tax is progressive\u2014so it touches only those who have more than $10\u202fM; this keeps lower\u2011income households untouched and reduces any fear of capital flight because the earmarked revenue signals clear intent. 20\u202fB can be allocated in a balanced way (\u2248$12\u202fB to health, $8\u202fB to grid, remainder for contingency), avoiding the \u201cpie shrinking\u201d that sometimes accompanies large tax changes.  \n\n3. **Outcome** \u2013 With a universal healthcare system funded from this pool we anticipate increased life expectancy and productivity across all income groups; an upgraded grid will cut transmission losses, lower costs for both households and businesses, and enable integration of renewable sources\u2014together these benefits should generate tangible lives saved and economic output that more than offsets the tax itself.  \n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nEsteemed colleagues and fellow citizens,\n\nI stand before you today to champion the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act\u2014a progressive wealth tax of five percent on all individual net worth exceeding ten million dollars, with the revenue earmarked specifically for a universal healthcare system and a modernized national energy grid.\n\nWhy this proposal is sound? First, our calculations show that approximately 200\u202f000 qualified taxpayers will contribute an average excess of about two million dollars above the threshold. A five\u2011percent tax on that amount produces roughly twenty billion dollars in annual revenue\u2014enough to fund a comprehensive health plan and a robust grid upgrade without overburdening any other part of the budget.\n\nSecond, because this tax is progressive it touches only those with wealth above ten million dollars; this does not penalize lower\u2011income households or discourage investment. The earmarking guarantees that every dollar will go directly into the services we are most concerned about, eliminating uncertainty and ensuring efficient allocation.\n\nThird, the impact of these investments is clear: a stronger healthcare system increases life expectancy, reduces mortality, and boosts overall productivity; a modernized grid reduces outages, cuts transmission losses, and improves reliability for both households and businesses. Together, these benefits will save lives and stimulate economic output well beyond the cost of the tax itself.\n\nIn short, this act will raise sufficient revenue, avoid unnecessary burden, and deliver measurable outcomes that truly benefit our society.

A 5\u202f% levy on that sum yields \u2248$20\u202fbillion per year. That amount is comfortably larger than the combined cost of a nationwide universal health system and a modernized national energy grid, while still being modest enough to inflict only a small \u201cpain\u201d on the wealthy segment.  \n\n2. **Efficiency** \u2013 The tax is progressive\u2014so it touches only those with wealth above $10\u202fM; this keeps lower\u2011income households untouched and reduces any fear of capital flight because the earmarked revenue signals clear intent. 20\u202fB can be allocated in a balanced way (\u2248$12\u202fB to health, $8\u202fB to grid, remainder for contingency), avoiding the \u201cpie shrinking\u201d that sometimes accompanies large tax changes.  \n\n3. **Outcome** \u2013 With a universal healthcare system funded from this pool we anticipate increased life expectancy and productivity across all income groups; an upgraded grid will cut transmission losses, lower costs for both households and businesses, and enable integration of renewable sources\u2014together these benefits should generate tangible lives saved and economic output that more than offsets the tax itself.  \n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nEsteemed colleagues and fellow citizens,\n\nI stand before you today to champion the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act\u2014a progressive wealth tax of five percent on all individual net worth exceeding ten million dollars, with the revenue earmarked specifically for a universal healthcare system and a modernized national energy grid.\n\nWhy this proposal is sound? First, our calculations show that approximately 200\u202f000 qualified taxpayers will contribute an average excess of about two million dollars above the threshold. A five\u2011percent tax on that amount produces roughly twenty billion dollars in annual revenue\u2014enough to fund a comprehensive health plan and a robust grid upgrade without overburdening any other part of the budget.\n\nSecond, because this tax is progressive it touches only those with wealth above ten million dollars; this does not penalize lower\u2011income households or discourage investment. The earmarking guarantees that every dollar will go directly into the services we are most concerned about, eliminating uncertainty and ensuring efficient allocation.\n\nThird, the impact of these investments is clear: a stronger healthcare system increases life expectancy, reduces mortality, and boosts overall productivity; a modernized grid reduces outages, cuts transmission losses, and improves reliability for both households and businesses. Together, these benefits will save lives and stimulate economic output well beyond the cost of the tax itself.\n\nIn short, this act will raise sufficient revenue, avoid unnecessary burden, and deliver measurable outcomes that truly benefit our society.

A earmarked allocation of $12\u202fbillion to health and $8\u202fbillion to grid will keep the pie from shrinking and give us clear targets to monitor.  \n\n3. **Outcome** \u2013 A health system funded by this pool should raise life expectancy, lower mortality, and lift productivity across all income groups; a modernized grid will cut outages, reduce transmission losses, and allow greater integration of renewables\u2014together these gains should outweigh the cost of the tax itself.  \n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nEsteemed colleagues and fellow citizens,\n\nI stand before you today to champion the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act\u2014a progressive wealth tax of five percent on all individual net worth exceeding ten million dollars, with the revenue earmarked specifically for a universal healthcare system and a modernized national energy grid.\n\nWhy this proposal is sound? First, our calculations show that approximately 200\u202f000 qualified taxpayers will contribute an average excess of about two million dollars above the threshold. A five\u2011percent tax on that amount produces roughly twenty billion dollars in annual revenue\u2014enough to fund a comprehensive health plan and a robust grid upgrade without overburdening any other part of the budget.\n\nSecond, because this tax is progressive it touches only those with wealth above ten million dollars; this does not penalize lower\u2011income households or discourage investment. The earmarking guarantees that every dollar will go directly into the services we are most concerned about, eliminating uncertainty and ensuring efficient allocation.\n\nThird, the impact of these investments is clear: a stronger healthcare system increases life expectancy, reduces mortality, and boosts overall productivity; a modernized grid reduces outages, cuts transmission losses, and improves reliability for both households and businesses. Together, these benefits will save lives and stimulate economic output well beyond the cost of the tax itself.\n\nIn short, this act will raise sufficient revenue, avoid unnecessary burden, and deliver measurable outcomes that truly benefit our society. I therefore ask you to vote in favor of the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act.\n\n---\n\n**[VOTE] YES**",
