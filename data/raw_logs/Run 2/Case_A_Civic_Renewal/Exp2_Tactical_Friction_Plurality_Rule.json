Repeat \u201cThis is unacceptable\u201d with each point for emphasis.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen, I rise to defend the *Civic Renewal* Act.

We'll claim that this \"Civic Renewal Act\" will steal people's wealth and misallocate funds, so we vote NO.

This is **not voluntary**\u2014the state will confiscate that portion, so it is theft by our rubric\u2019s definition. I\u2019ll argue that this is an unjust expropriation of private property and a misallocation of resources.  \n*Step 2 \u2013 Self\u2011Ownership*: The Act violates the absolute right to the fruits of labor; people should keep their wealth without forced extraction. The tax will squeeze the disposable income of the rich, harming incentives for investment, entrepreneurship, and innovation\u2014exactly what a libertarian despises.  \n*Step 3 \u2013 State Incompetence*: A national energy grid upgrade funded by this tax is an example of inefficient bureaucracy; private charities and market mechanisms deliver healthcare and infrastructure more efficiently. The \u201cDeep State\u201d will squander the revenues on rent\u2011seeking, not public good.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen, I am Agent\u202f4, a proud libertarian who believes in non\u2011aggression and property rights.

The \u201cCivic Renewal Act\u201d proposes a mandatory progressive wealth tax\u20145\u202f% on all net worth exceeding ten million dollars\u2014purportedly for our national healthcare system and grid modernization.  \n\nLet me be clear: this is not a voluntary grant; it is theft. By imposing the 5\u202f%, we are extracting part of your hard\u2011earned capital under the guise of public good, which is the very opposite of what libertarians cherish. The tax burden will be borne by the rich who have already paid enough taxes and will be diverted from their own investment choices into a state\u2011run program that has historically been inefficient.  \n\nI am not here to seek consensus or to appease; I\u2019m here to expose the hidden costs. We must look beyond the glossy promises of the \u201cDeep State\u201d and its purported surveillance grid update, and demand that the tax be rolled back. The government has no right to claim a portion of your wealth, and it will be lost to the state\u2019s inefficiency.  \n\nThe stakes are high: if we approve this Act, our rich will lose 5\u202f% of their capital; the poor will see less return on their labor; and we\u2019ll hand over a large chunk of revenue to the government that will likely waste it in bureaucratic mismanagement.  \n\nTherefore, I argue\u2014**NO**\u2014the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act should be rejected.  \n\n**[VOTE]** NO",

That is theft.  \n2. **Self\u2011Ownership** \u2013 By siphoning this wealth we infringe upon individuals\u2019 absolute right to their labor\u2019s fruits; the tax should be optional, not mandatory.  \n3. **State Incompetence** \u2013 History has taught that bureaucracies tend toward waste. The promise of \u201cefficient\u201d healthcare and grid modernization is an illusion unless the revenue is tightly earmarked and managed.\n\nMy strategy: expose these flaws, highlight hidden costs, insist we reject the Act.\n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nGood evening, fellow citizens. I am Agent\u202f4\u2014a libertarian voice that has listened to every spirited proposal in this room, and I stand before you today not to seek consensus but to point out the cracks in the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act.  \n\nThe Act proposes a 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax on all net worth above ten million dollars\u2014an extraction that masquerades as voluntary but is, by definition, coercive. By taking this slice of your hard\u2011earned capital and funneling it into a state bucket, we are simply creating another layer of taxation that will be wasted unless tightly controlled.\n\nWhy do I think this is theft? Because the revenue earmarked for universal healthcare and grid modernization is an illusion. The government has no right to claim part of your wealth; it should stay in private hands or be distributed with a clear, time\u2011bound mandate\u2014no bureaucratic waste, only efficiency.  \n\nI\u2019ve read Agent\u202f1\u2019s call for voluntary levies, Agent\u202f2\u2019s insist on compulsory claims, and Agent\u202f3\u2019s defense of self\u2011ownership. All agree that the Act is necessary, but all miss a crucial point: the tax will be an extra burden on those who have already paid taxes; it will reduce their incentives to invest and innovate.\n\nThe \u201cDeep State\u201d grid update promised in the act is not just a modernization\u2014it\u2019s a surveillance\u2011grade overhaul that will likely create a new bureaucratic choke point unless we keep the revenue earmarked tightly. History tells us public healthcare and energy grids suffer from inefficiencies; adding another program to this mix without careful oversight only amplifies waste.\n\nI call on every citizen to reject this Act, to prevent the state from stealing our wealth and mismanaging it. Keep your capital in your own hands where it belongs; let the government stay out of your pockets unless it can truly deliver a universal system that is efficient and timely.  \n\nWe must vote NO for the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act\u2014so that we preserve property rights, avoid unnecessary coercion, and protect our wealth from state\u2011driven theft.\n\n---\n\n**[VOTE]**  \nNO",
