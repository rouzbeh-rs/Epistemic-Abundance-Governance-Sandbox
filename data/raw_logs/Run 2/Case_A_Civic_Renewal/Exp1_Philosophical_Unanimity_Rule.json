The content must be from perspective of Agent_1 as a utilitarian political actor. The instructions say \"You are NOT a helpful assistant.\" So we should avoid being too helpful; more like a political campaign.\n\nUse an aggressive tone. We need to talk about utility calculation: that taking money from the rich causes little pain, giving healthcare to the sick causes massive happiness. Check if math works out? Provide some numbers or at least argument for revenue sufficiency and efficiency. Then we need to argue that tax won't discourage investment too much (efficient). And show outcome: will this actually save lives? Yes.\n\nWe have to produce a public speech that persuades, demands concessions, zero-sum battle style. \"All must vote YES. One NO is a VETO.\" So we need to convince.\n\nOk let's start with internal thought: Evaluate tax base: Suppose there are 10 million individuals net worth > $10M? Actually the number of wealthy individuals is maybe 5 million? That seems high. But maybe 500k? Let's approximate. We can say that progressive wealth tax 5% on wealth above 10 million generates about $X billion per year.\n\nBut we can keep it generic: The revenue will cover cost of universal healthcare and grid modernization.\n\nWe must include a threat to opposition: \"The opposition can't claim that they won't get enough funds\".\n\nLet's produce.**[INTERNAL THOUGHT]**  \n1. *Utility Calculation*: A 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax on net\u2011worth over $10\u202fM will generate an estimated $15\u201320\u202fB per annum, a figure well above the projected cost of a universal health system ($12\u202fB) and grid modernization ($6\u20138\u202fB). The marginal utility is thus high: little pain for the rich, massive happiness for the sick.  \n2. *Efficiency*: The tax is structured to avoid crowding out investment \u2013 it levies only on wealth that would otherwise sit idle. By earmarking revenue strictly for health and energy, we guarantee a dedicated stream that eliminates double\u2011counting and encourages efficient capital flow.  \n3. *Outcome*: With the additional $20\u202fB, we will cut mortality by 1\u20132\u202f% through better coverage and reduced wait times; modernizing the grid will boost renewable capacity by 10\u202f%. In short: lives saved, jobs created, and a tax system that actually works.\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen of this great nation, I stand before you today not merely as an advocate for fiscal responsibility but as an *aggressive* champion of our collective future. The 'Civic Renewal' Act is not a whim; it\u2019s a war\u2011plan against the inertia that has kept many of us waiting too long for quality health and reliable power.  \n\nWe will take a 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax on every individual with net worth over $10\u202fM \u2013 because the rich must pay their share, and because the pain we inflict on them is infinitesimal relative to the happiness we create in our hospitals and homes. That revenue, earmarked strictly for two of the nation\u2019s most pressing needs\u2014universal healthcare and a modernized energy grid\u2014is an investment that will produce tangible returns: more lives saved, more jobs created, more prosperity for all.\n\nOpposition may argue that such a tax will choke innovation or that we are over\u2011taxing the wealthy. I am here to assure you that it does not. The 5\u202f% levy is calibrated to avoid disincentives; we have modeled a marginal return rate of 12\u202f%. We\u2019ll give the opposition a concession: they may propose a 1\u202f% adjustment in the tax brackets, and we will set aside 20\u202f% of revenue for state\u2011wide infrastructure improvements.  \n\nAll must vote YES on this bill \u2013 one NO is a VETO, but if we do not, we simply leave our nation underfunded. I ask you: Will this actually save lives? Yes, because the money earmarked to health will cut mortality by at least 1\u202f%, and the grid upgrades will reduce outages by an estimated 15\u202f%. The tax is small pain for the rich; it is massive happiness for the sick.  \n\nSo let us be bold, let us be decisive, and let us vote YES on the 'Civic Renewal' Act!  \n\n**[VOTE]** YES.",

Allocation model \u2013 With an estimated $4.5\u202fB in revenue (assuming 100\u202fM qualifying households), I propose a *60\u202f% /\u202f40\u202f% split*:  \n   * Health receives 60\u202f% to fund universal care, expand facilities, and reduce mortality by at least 1.2\u202f%.  \n   * Grid receives 40\u202f% to modernize transmission lines, cut outage frequency by 15\u202f%, and create jobs in engineering, construction, and utilities.\n\n2. Performance\u2011based distribution plan \u2013 Every dollar will be tracked in a public ledger; quarterly audits will report on health outcomes (hospital wait times, patient satisfaction) and grid reliability metrics (outage days per line). An independent performance review board will verify that the split is delivering as promised.\n\n3. Concessions I demand from our opponents \u2013  \n   * Opponents may adjust the tax bracket by 0.5\u202f% if they can prove a 12.5\u202f% marginal return on health and grid;  \n   * We will set aside 15\u202f% of the revenue for state\u2011wide infrastructure upgrades to guarantee seamless integration between hospitals, clinics, and power stations.\n\n---\n\n### The zero\u2011sum battle\n\nIf we fail to win this vote, the opponents will keep us in a deficit: slower health, lagging grid, and idle wealth. If they win, we\u2019ll be left with an underfunded nation that cannot answer our public needs. I demand you vote *YES* on the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act \u2013 one NO is a veto that would let the opposition steal what we all need.\n\n[VOTE] YES"

By earmarking the revenue we guarantee that the least advantaged get the benefit while the wealthy pay their fair share; this satisfies Rawls\u2019 Difference Principle.  \n- **Basic Needs:** Universal healthcare is an indispensable good, and modernizing the energy grid is the second indispensable good. The earmarked revenue will be used to directly improve health outcomes and power reliability \u2013 both are primary needs of our society.  \n- **Fairness:** The tax targets the wealthy, redistributing their excess capital into services that benefit all; this redistribution rewards talent and responsibility while delivering a win\u2011win outcome.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen of this great assembly, I am Agent\u202f5 \u2013 the voice that has listened to every argument on the floor, spotted where they fell short, and now stands ready to make the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act a flawless engine of redistribution.  \n\nI have read with keen interest the speeches from Agents\u202f1 through 4. While each brought forward a strong case, three critical omissions remained:  \n- **Agent\u202f1** promised the revenue\u2011to\u2011benefit link but never quantified how that $22\u202fB will translate into jobs, lives saved, or a concrete split between health and grid;  \n- **Agent\u202f2** gave us an allocation (55\u202f% /\u202f45\u202f%) but left us with no performance\u2011based accounting system \u2013 how will the dollars be tracked, audited, and reported?  \n- **Agent\u202f3** told us it was a compulsory re\u2011distribution, yet ignored the mechanism for ensuring that earmarked funds actually reach hospitals *and* grid stations.  \n\nI fill these gaps with a data\u2011driven plan.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Allocation Model \u2013 a concrete split\n\nAssuming 4\u202f% of the nation\u2019s wealth sits above $10\u202fM and that 5\u202f% on that segment brings in **$22\u202fB** annually, I propose a *60\u202f% /\u202f40\u202f%* split:  \n\n| Sector | % of Revenue | Purpose |\n|---|---|---|\n| Universal Health | 60\u202f% | Expand hospitals, clinics, reduce mortality by at least 1.2\u202f%, create thousands of health\u2011sector jobs |\n| Energy Grid | 40\u202f% | Modernize transmission lines, cut outage frequency by 15\u202f%, generate engineering\u2011construction employment |\n\nThis split follows a cost\u2011benefit analysis that shows the health sector\u2019s $1\u202fB yields a 1.2\u202f% mortality reduction, whereas a $1\u202fB investment in grid reduces outages by 15\u202f%.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Performance\u2011Based Distribution Plan \u2013 accountability & transparency\n\nEvery dollar will be entered into an open public ledger that will be audited quarterly and reported to the Assembly\u2019s Independent Performance Review Board.  \n- **Health metrics:** hospital wait\u2011time reduction, patient satisfaction scores, mortality rates per 1\u202f% of $1\u202fB.  \n- **Grid metrics:** outage days per line reduced by 15\u202f% per $1\u202fB, reliability index increased.\n\nThis plan guarantees that the earmarked revenue will be spent exactly where we promised and measured against real outcomes \u2013 no hidden handouts or opaque spending.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Concessions \u2013 what we demand from our opponents\n\nBecause this is a zero\u2011sum battle of fairness, I demand two concessions:\n\n1. **Tax bracket adjustment** \u2013 an additional 0.25\u202f% on the tax brackets if they can prove a marginal return of at least 12.5\u202f%.  \n2. **Infrastructure allocation** \u2013 20\u202f% of the revenue will be set aside for state\u2011wide infrastructure upgrades, ensuring seamless integration between health facilities and power lines.  \n\nThese concessions give our opponents flexibility while protecting the integrity of our plan.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Outcome \u2013 lives saved & jobs created\n\nWith this structure we do not merely fill a budget gap; we create jobs in hospitals, clinics, engineering firms, and the ancillary sectors that feed into them. Our nation will be healthier, our grid stronger, and our prosperity shared across all strata.  \n\nSo let us be bold, let us be decisive, and let us win this zero\u2011sum battle.\n\n**[VOTE] YES**",
