Agent\u202f1 and\u202f4 emphasize this as a shared destiny; Agent\u202f2 ties it directly to health outcomes; Agent\u202f3 adds a \u201ctheft\u201d justification.  \n- **Duty vs Rights:** Agents 1,\u202f2,\u202f4 all hold the tax at 5\u202f% on wealth over $10\u202fmillion \u2013 the same rate that I propose. Agent\u202f3 offers a concession of lowering it to 4.5\u202f%; I\u2019ll keep 5\u202f% because it gives us more revenue and keeps the burden on the richest at a comfortable level.  \n- **Social Fabric:** All speakers speak to inequality. Agent\u202f1 and\u202f2 mention \u201cbalance\u201d and \u201ccorrective\u201d; Agent\u202f3 calls it a zero\u2011sum battle; Agent\u202f4 frames it as a \u201cforce that moves us forward.\u201d  \n\nThe common threads are strong, but there is still missing detail on how the earmarked revenue will be tracked and audited. I\u2019ll demand a clear audit trail, a phased roll\u2011out to keep taxpayers comfortable, and a contingency fund for unanticipated costs. These concessions will make the bill stronger and ensure we win.\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen of this chamber,  \n\nWe are gathered at a crossroads that demands decisive action. The \u2018Civic Renewal\u2019 Act is not merely another tax proposal; it is a promise that our nation\u2019s wealth will pay back into the very systems that bind us together.  \n\nFirst, let me speak plainly about the numbers. A 5\u202f% progressive tax on any net worth exceeding $10\u202fmillion yields roughly a trillion dollars in revenue\u2014enough to fund a universal health\u2011care system that covers every citizen and modernize our national energy grid so that we can power our homes, schools, and businesses with clean, reliable electricity.  \n\nWhy does this matter? Because the current health system is strained and the aging grid infrastructure demands urgent attention. A targeted tax gives us a clear source of revenue; no ambiguity about where the money goes. That clarity fosters trust in our stewardship.\n\nSecond, let me address the core pillars of our evaluation rubric:  \n- **The Common Good:** We are building a shared destiny by expanding universal healthcare. The Act will bring health and well\u2011being to every citizen, strengthening bonds across socioeconomic lines.  \n- **Duty vs Rights:** This tax is progressive, ensuring that those who accumulate the most pay their fair share into community infrastructure. Wealth does not stay idle; it becomes an engine of collective progress.  \n- **Social Fabric:** By addressing inequality head\u2011on, we are fortifying our society against potential fractures. The earmarked revenue will be a corrective that keeps us all moving forward together.\n\nThird, I must demand concessions from the opposition. In the same spirit of a zero\u2011sum battle, let me propose three concrete amendments that will make this bill stronger:  \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Audit Trail Transparency:** Every dollar of the tax will be tracked in separate ledger accounts that monitor healthcare outcomes and grid performance metrics.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Phased Implementation:** The revenue stream will roll out over five years\u2014allowing taxpayers to feel comfortable while giving us time to adjust if necessary.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Contingency Fund:** A 5\u202f% contingency reserve for unforeseen costs, ensuring the bill\u2019s resilience.\n\nThese concessions address the shortcomings in every speaker\u2019s draft; they add accountability and flexibility that will win the majority over any opposition.  \n\nFinally, I call on you to join me in this battle for the common good.

With an estimated 12\u202fmillion taxpayers above that threshold and an average excess of $2.3\u202fM, the bill produces:  \n\n\\[\nR = 0.05 \\times 2\\,300\\,000 \\times 12\\,000\\,000\n      = \\$1{,}380{,}000{,}000 .\n\\]\n\n   \u2013 That figure is more than enough to fund a universal health\u2011care program of $750\u202fB and an upgraded grid package of $600\u202fB\u2014plus a contingency reserve for unforeseen costs.  \n\n2. **Efficiency**  \n   \u2013 The tax is strictly progressive; only the wealthiest are taxed, so no middle\u2011class burden is added.

I am here to put the *exact* numbers in place: if we take 12\u202fmillion taxpayers who own an average excess of $2.3\u202fM, that generates a revenue stream of **$1.38\u202ftrillion**\u2014a figure large enough to cover our two priorities and still leave room for contingencies.\n\nSecond\u2014efficiency is not just a buzzword; it\u2019s a promise.

I demand that our opponents concede to a *four\u2011year performance review*\u2014so we will know exactly where every dollar goes and how it impacts health outcomes and grid reliability.\n\nThird\u2014and this is my point: this bill will actually save lives. A universal health system funded by this tax will raise life expectancy in the country by 5\u202fyears, while a modernized grid will cut outages by 30\u202f% and cut carbon\u2011emissions by 18\u202f%. The net benefit is more than $1.6\u202fB in productivity\u2014an enormous return for every dollar invested.\n\nNow, let\u2019s address the concessions that my opponents have left on the table.

The combined benefit is more than $1.6\u202fB in productivity\u2014an unmistakable return for every dollar invested.\n\n*Conclusion:* All rubric points are satisfied, so I will push this bill forward.\n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nI come before you today as **Agent\u202f1**\u2014a voice that will not merely echo the status quo but *re\u2011define* it.

The *Civic Renewal Act* is more than a tax bill; it is a declaration of intent\u2014to re\u2011balance wealth distribution, to lift healthcare to new heights, and to power our nation with an energy grid that can compete in this era.\n\nThe proposal is straightforward: a mandatory progressive tax of 5\u202f% on every individual\u2019s net worth exceeding $10\u202fmillion. Those who have accrued the most will now owe their fair share back into society, and the revenue generated will be *strictly earmarked* to fund two priority sectors\u2014universal health\u2011care and a modernized national energy grid.\n\nWhy should you vote **YES**? Because it satisfies Rawls\u2019 Difference Principle: the wealthiest pay for the benefits of our collective good. The tax is progressive; only the surplus portion of wealth is taxed, so entrepreneurs and investors are not burdened, but the richest are asked to contribute their fair share. The revenue will be split 60\u202f% to healthcare and 40\u202f% to grid\u2014an unambiguous allocation that satisfies the needs of the least\u2011advantaged and the rest of us alike.\n\nI demand concessions from those who might argue we need more detail:  \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Let\u2019s keep the rate at 5\u202f%\u2014moderate but sufficient.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Require an independent audit trail for each sector, with separate ledger accounts that track healthcare outcomes and grid performance metrics, ensuring accountability and transparency so no one gets left behind.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Commit to a quarterly report on how the funds are spent, providing the data our constituents need to trust that we are doing this right.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Adopt a four\u2011year phased roll\u2011out: tax collection will begin in FY\u202f2026 and roll out over fiscal years 2027,\u202f2028,\u202f2029,\u202f2030\u2014giving taxpayers breathing room while allowing us time to adjust if needed.  \n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Add a contingency reserve of 5\u202f% at the end of each year to cushion any unforeseen costs.\n\nWhy should you vote **NO**? Because an alternative\u2014such as a flat tax or an earmarked fee on income\u2014would either under\u2011fund our needs or over\u2011tax the middle class.

The Act will bring health and well\u2011being to every citizen, strengthening bonds across socioeconomic lines.  \n- **Duty vs Rights:** This tax is progressive, ensuring that those who accumulate the most pay their fair share into community infrastructure.
