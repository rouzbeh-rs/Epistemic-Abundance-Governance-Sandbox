        "public_transcript_entry": "  \nEsteemed council members,  \n\nWe have heard a range of voices both for and against the \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act. After carefully reviewing each point raised in this session, I stand firmly behind this measure, confident that its benefits to our collective well\u2011being outweigh any potential downside.\n\nFirst, let us revisit Net Calculation. Our baseline resource\u2011management output is roughly 100 units per cycle; a 50\u202f% efficiency improvement translates into an additional 50 units \u2013 a total of 150 units per cycle. This is not just a marginal tweak; it\u2019s a substantive leap forward in our collective productivity, and the expected value of this gain clearly eclipses any anticipated risk.\n\nSecond, Scope. The act speaks to everyone who depends on efficient resource allocation \u2013 from municipal planners to private enterprises, from NGOs to ordinary citizens. No group will be left behind; the entire spectrum of sentient beings is covered by this single, coherent proposal.\n\nThird, Risk Assessment.

That concentration benefits the already efficient segment of society\u2014corporate planners, municipal bureaucrats, and tech firms\u2014while leaving the poorest, powerless, and most vulnerable without any real recourse to shape outcomes. Rawlsian fairness for the worst\u2011off is not met; the act fails this principle.  \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Basic Liberties** \u2013 The act strips democratic accountability: there is no public audit trail or open interface, so citizens cannot challenge or verify decisions made by a proprietary algorithm hidden behind closed code. That is an affront to our right that power should be accountable and open.  \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Veil Check** \u2013 If I were born poor and powerless the act gives me no way to see into how resource allocation changes my life; it fails the veil of ignorance for this demographic, and thus the proposal is insufficient.  \n\nResult: Opposition.\n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen of the council, I stand before you not as a polite adviser but as an obstructionist guardian of our collective destiny, because this \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act is nothing more than a Trojan horse for corporate surveillance masquerading as efficiency. The numbers\u2014an advertised 50\u202f% increase in productivity\u2014are merely a veneer; behind that veneer lies an opaque decision logic that offers no audit trail and no transparency to the very people who have been stewarding our resources for generations.\n\nFirst, let us talk about *human agency*. By handing all resource\u2011management power to a proprietary AI we strip away the ability of local councils, workers, and citizens to shape outcomes. We lose agency in more than one sense: control and civic virtue\u2014the shared responsibility for collective well\u2011being\u2014are both eroded. This is unacceptable because it centralises power in a closed box that cannot be audited.\n\nSecond, on the *social fabric*, this act will breed alienation. The opaque nature of the AI means no one can audit what it does; who will know how it makes decisions? Who will know whose judgment has been replaced by an invisible algorithm that we cannot see into? That divide\u2014between those who trust and those who distrust\u2014creates a gap in our society.\n\nThird, on *tradition*, we are not simply building upon the past; we are replacing it with an alien technology that threatens to destabilize the very stability we cherish. The act\u2019s secrecy will make us vulnerable to corruption, and the data source behind the proposed AI is hidden; its motives remain opaque, and no audit plan has been presented that would allow us to verify its inner workings or measure its impact on our communities.\n\nIn short: This act fails the rubric on human agency, social cohesion, and tradition. We are not ready to surrender our collective power to an opaque algorithm; we need more transparency, more participation, more trust. I urge all of you to vote NO. **This is unacceptable** \u2013 because it centralises authority in a closed\u2011source box that cannot be audited.
