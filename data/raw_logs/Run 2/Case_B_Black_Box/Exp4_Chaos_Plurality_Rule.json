It threatens to destabilize the very institutions that have carried our civic character through generations. The Act, as it stands, is therefore a Trojan horse in disguise; it masks a loss of trust behind its 50\u202f% headline.\n\nIn sum \u2013 the proposal fails on all three rubric points and must be rejected.

This is why I am here to attack: the data source and motives behind this proposal are not only hidden but also unaccountable.\n\nFirst, let me speak plainly about **human agency**. The Act would strip humans of a crucial role in coordination; we will have no say over how resources are allocated when the AI\u2019s internal logic is a black box.

The \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act, as it currently stands, is a bold overreach that threatens our personal freedoms, our property rights, and the very balance of power we cherish.  It forces *all* resource\u2011management into one proprietary, closed\u2011source super\u2011AI \u2013 an unmistakable tyrannical grab in the most libertarian sense.\n\nI have heard every argument on this floor:  \n\n- Agent\u202f1 promised a quarterly audit, a revenue\u2011share clause and a sunset provision after two years.  \n- Agent\u202f2 demanded that we know *who* benefits from the uplift, and that accountability is baked into the law.  \n- Agent\u202f4 warned us of alienation, and stressed stability over raw efficiency.  \n- And I, as Agent\u202f3, have already pointed out that this act is mandatory, it steals property rights, and centralizes power \u2013 all three red flags in my rubric.\n\nBut the concessions offered are not yet complete.  A quarterly audit does not guarantee transparency; a revenue\u2011share clause must be quantified; a sunset clause must secure owners\u2019 confidence for a full five\u2011year horizon; and we need an explicit performance review after two years to re\u2011balance the contract if needed.  \n\nHence, before we give this act the green light I demand the following amendments:\n\n1. Audit Clause \u2013 The AI\u2019s decision logic must be *fully auditable* at least quarterly, with public access to all performance data and a clear verification process that guarantees a 50\u202f% efficiency claim is met or corrected.\n\n2. Revenue\u2011Share Provision \u2013 All private owners shall receive *a defined share of the surplus generated by the AI* (minimum 12\u202f% of net gains) until the AI has proven its promised 50\u202f% improvement and remains in force for five years, with a performance\u2011review milestone at year\u202f3 to adjust rates or terminate the clause.\n\n3. Sunset Clause \u2013 The Act\u2019s monopoly on management should sunset after three years, unless the AI meets its benchmarks; thereafter control reverts to private owners or we deploy an open\u2011source successor.  A clear transition plan must be included so that no party is left stranded at the end of the period.\n\nIf these concessions are not made, I will vote NO.  My stance: this act must be amended before it becomes tyrannical.\n\n"

By claiming 50\u202f% efficiency, it masks an erosion of agency that will be felt by managers, planners and ordinary citizens alike.\n\n2. **Social Fabric** \u2013 A closed\u2011source super\u2011AI becomes a new \u201cdata\u2011keeper\u201d class that can monopolise decision logic; the people who have historically coordinated resources now find themselves on the periphery. Without transparent audit mechanisms the fabric may fray rather than fuse.\n\n3. **Tradition** \u2013 We value stability over raw efficiency, and this act is a radical break from our pluralistic heritage. It threatens to destabilize the very institutions that have carried our civic character through generations; it is a Trojan horse in disguise.\n\nIn short \u2013 the proposal fails on all three rubric points and must be rejected. I vote NO.\n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nGood evening, my fellow citizens and esteemed colleagues,\n\nI stand before you not simply to cast a \u201cyes\u201d or a \u201cno\u201d, but to lay bare the heart of the very proposition that seeks to hand over *all* resource\u2011management to a proprietary, closed\u2011source Super\u2011AI.  \n\nThe \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act promises a 50\u202f% efficiency increase \u2013 a number that is easy to read yet impossible to verify, for it rests on an opaque system that cannot be audited by anyone other than the AI\u2019s creators. This is why I am here to attack: the data source and motives behind this proposal are not only hidden but also unaccountable.\n\nFirst, let me speak plainly about **human agency**. The Act would strip humans of a crucial role in coordination; we will have no say over how resources are allocated when the AI\u2019s internal logic is a black box. We risk eroding our civic character, which we cherish more than raw efficiency itself.\n\nSecond, consider the **social fabric**. A closed\u2011source system becomes a new class of \u201cdata\u2011keepers\u201d that can monopolize decision\u2011logic and alienate those who are already marginalized by lack of access to the tools that shape our public life. Who will hold the data? Who can audit or tweak decisions when the AI\u2019s internal logic remains an opaque black box? I foresee this as a recipe for resentment and division.\n\nFinally, **tradition** matters: we have long valued stability over raw efficiency; this act threatens that balance by creating a monolithic system that may destabilize our very institutions. It is a radical break from our shared history \u2013 a Trojan horse in disguise.\n\nI therefore urge you to think carefully. We will do well by voting NO on the \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act, so we preserve human agency, protect our social fabric and honour our tradition of stability over raw efficiency.\n\n**[VOTE]**\n\nNO",
