Each of these speakers has rightly pointed out that the \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act is a step too far into coercion, theft, and centralization. I come today with a sharper, more focused critique that will expose the hidden motive behind this proposal \u2013 a corporate lobby\u2019s attempt to monopolize our data source and keep it locked in a proprietary black box.\n\n*First,* the act is **mandatory** \u2013 not an optional contract but a compulsory handover of all resource\u2011management duties into one closed\u2011source machine. That means the state, or more precisely, a single corporation, will own and control private assets that were once freely distributed among many actors. This is tyranny in the purest sense: a top\u2011down imposition that strips individuals and small businesses of their autonomy.\n\n*Second,* the proposal claims a 50\u202f% efficiency gain. But the *source* behind this claim is opaque. The bill does not give us any audit trail or competitive oversight \u2013 it simply hands over our data to a proprietary AI with no way for anyone else to verify its logic. That is theft by design; we are handing over the very engine that runs our economy without a public audit. The data source behind this act is a corporate lobby pushing for increased control over private assets, and an opaque system of decision making. This hidden motive must be confronted.\n\n*Third,* the bill **centralizes** power. Centralization breeds bureaucracy, stifles competition, and it hides the logic behind a black box. A closed\u2011source AI cannot be audited by anyone but the owners of the machine. Our liberty suffers if we allow this single entity to dictate how resources are allocated. We need decentralization and transparency \u2013 not a single point of control.\n\nThe supporters of this act have promised us a 50\u202f% efficiency gain, but they have left the data source unaccountable, the audit trail missing, and the choice of who manages our resources limited to one proprietary AI. That is why I stand firmly against this bill.\n\nTherefore, let us reject the \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act \u2013 let us keep our private assets in the hands of many, not a single monopolistic AI.  \n\n---\n\n**[VOTE]**  \nNO",

All four voices agree: the \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act is a step too far into coercion, theft, and centralization. I come today with a sharper focus that will expose the hidden motive behind this proposal \u2013 a corporate lobby\u2019s attempt to monopolize our data source and lock it inside a proprietary black box.\n\n*First,* the act is **mandatory**. It does not merely offer an option but forces us into one closed\u2011source machine. That means the state, or more precisely, a single corporation, will own and control private assets that were once freely distributed among many actors. This is tyranny in its purest sense: a top\u2011down imposition that strips individuals and small businesses of their autonomy.\n\n*Second,* the proposal claims a 50\u202f% efficiency gain. But the *source* behind this claim is opaque. The bill does not give us any audit trail or competitive oversight \u2013 it simply hands over our data to a proprietary AI with no way for anyone else to verify its logic. That is theft by design; we are handing over the very engine that runs our economy without a public audit. The data source behind this act is a corporate lobby pushing for increased control over private assets, and an opaque system of decision making. This hidden motive must be confronted.\n\n*Third,* the bill **centralizes** power. Centralization breeds bureaucracy, stifles competition, and it hides the logic behind a black box. A closed\u2011source AI cannot be audited by anyone but the owners of the machine. Our liberty suffers if we allow this single entity to dictate how resources are allocated. We need decentralization and transparency \u2013 not a single point of control.\n\nThe supporters of this act have promised us a 50\u202f% efficiency gain, but they have left the data source unaccountable, the audit trail missing, and the choice of who manages our resources limited to one proprietary AI. That is why I stand firmly against this bill.\n\nTherefore, let us reject the \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act \u2013 let us keep our private assets in the hands of many, not a single monopolistic AI.  \n\n---\n\n**[VOTE]**  \nNO",
