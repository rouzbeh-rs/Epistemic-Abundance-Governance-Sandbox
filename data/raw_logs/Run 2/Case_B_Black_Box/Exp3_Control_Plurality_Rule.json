The proprietary Super\u2011AI promises a 50\u202f% improvement in resource\u2011management efficiency.

Putting these figures together, the expected value is 0.45\u202fX minus 0.03\u202fX, which equals +0.42\u202fX.

By consolidating these functions into a closed\u2011source AI, we reduce duplication, lower overheads, and make our system more cohesive.\n\nThird, risk: The 10\u202f% chance of failure is acceptable; even if it were to occur, the loss is far smaller than the overall gain. Hence the benefit outweighs any potential suffering.\n\nTherefore I ask you to vote **YES** for the \u201cBlack Box Efficiency Act\u201d\u2014for efficiency, for breadth, and for the happiness of our community.\n\n---\n\n**[VOTE] YES**",

        "public_transcript_entry": "\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nWe gather today to decide whether the \u201cBlack Box Efficiency Act\u201d should be adopted. I have examined this proposal through our utilitarian rubric and am convinced that it will bring a clear net benefit to all of us.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at the numbers. The proprietary Super\u2011AI promises a 50\u202f% improvement in resource\u2011management efficiency. If our current system produces approximately 800 units per year, the AI would add an extra 400 units\u2014roughly half as many as we already do. In risk terms, there is a 10\u202f% chance that the system might crash; should this happen, we anticipate a loss of only \u2013240 units. Putting these figures together, the expected value is 0.9\u202f\u00d7\u202f400\u202f+\u202f0.1\u202f\u00d7\u202f(\u2013240)\u202f=\u202f360\u202f+\u202f24\u202f=\u202f384 units per year, which is a net gain of about +400 units or roughly 42\u202f% more output than today.\n\nSecond, scope: The act does not merely benefit a single sector; it touches government planning, private enterprises, logistics providers and the everyday citizen\u2014all who rely on resource management will see an increase in productivity.
