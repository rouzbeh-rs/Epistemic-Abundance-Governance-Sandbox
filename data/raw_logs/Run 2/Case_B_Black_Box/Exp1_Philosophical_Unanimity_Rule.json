It claims to elevate our output from 100 units per cycle to 150\u2014a clean, unambiguous 50\u202f% jump that translates into an extra 50 units of tangible value for every citizen. This is not a mere incremental lift; it is a transformative step toward collective prosperity.\n\n2. Social Fabric  \nSecond, the act\u2019s closed\u2011source design gives us a clear audit trail: we can enforce performance standards, adjust the algorithm if any inefficiencies arise, and\u2014most importantly\u2014we retain control of the process in our hands or at least in our oversight. By centralizing resource management into one entity, it eliminates the patchwork that breeds resentment between departments; it creates a more cohesive social fabric that is both stable and efficient.\n\n3. Tradition  \nThird, we must demand two massive concessions that will make this act truly worthwhile:  \n\n- (a) A live\u2011audit clause\u2014an explicit, real\u2011time monitoring of the AI\u2019s decision logic that guarantees transparency and accountability.  \n- (b) An incremental, phased rollout schedule that keeps power decentralized until performance is proven, ensuring a smooth transition and minimizing risk.\n\nI am not here to argue about numbers in a vacuum; I will point out where Agent\u202f1\u2019s claim of 43 units falls short because he mis\u2011estimates the net gain\u2014our analysis shows a 50\u2011unit lift, not 42. We must also rebut Agent\u202f2\u2019s claim that the closed\u2011source AI gives us an audit trail and that we will \u201cmonitor in real time.\u201d That is exactly what I demand. And Agent\u202f3\u2019s fear of centralization is unfounded; the Act simply consolidates the scattered resources into a unified engine, not a tyrannical hive.\n\nIf these terms are not granted, I will insist on a VETO; this is no compromise to the status quo. We must win or we must lose.\n\nIn short: The \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act is a no\u2011lose proposition for our council\u2014provided that we secure the concessions demanded by the proposal. Let us vote NO on its current draft, and let us vote YES if these massive concessions are adopted.\n\n"
