The expected value is therefore +90\u202fm or 45\u202f% above baseline, satisfying the utilitarian criterion that more happiness will accrue from the proposal.)  \n2. *Scope*: Handing all resource\u2011management to a single proprietary, closed\u2011source Super\u2011AI will centralise every sector\u2014public, private and governmental\u2014from logistics to finance, thus benefiting the majority of sentient beings by streamlining workflows and cutting redundancy. No niche or marginal group is excluded; therefore the scope criterion is met.)  \n3. *Risk Assessment*: The only downside is audit opacity, but the closed\u2011source model guarantees a deterministic decision tree that can be monitored via an external \u201cblack\u2011box\u201d verification protocol we will demand as part of the concession clause. If the system crashes, the loss (\u224810\u202f%) is dwarfed by the 50\u202f% gain; expected value remains positive.)  \nConclusion: All rubric criteria satisfied\u2014therefore I vote YES unless a massive concession can be demanded that improves oversight and accountability.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen, this isn\u2019t just another bill.

That means less time wasted on inter\u2011departmental hand\u2011offs, fewer errors, and an overall productivity leap that *benefits* the majority of us sentient beings\u2014public, private, and governmental alike.  \n\nNow, I am not here to simply ask for your vote; I demand a concession: a rigorous external audit protocol, a transparent verification system, and a clear exit clause in case of failure. Those are non\u2011negotiable terms if this act is to truly win. The risk? It\u2019s 10\u202f%\u2014but our expected gain is 45\u202f% above baseline; that margin is *not* trivial.  \n\nI urge you: vote YES.

The same goes for Agent\u202f3\u2019s fear of \u201ctyrannical grab\u201d; I too agree that an opaque AI risks alienation unless it is bounded by a clear audit trail and a hybrid oversight committee.\n\nAgent\u202f4 insists on \u201chuman agency\u201d and \u201csocial cohesion.\u201d  Those are not merely niceties\u2014they are the lifeblood of any public program.  Therefore, before we can vote YES, I will demand two massive concessions:\n\n1) Open\u2011Source Audit Clause \u2013 The AI\u2019s decision logic must be open to a public audit protocol; quarterly performance dashboards and transparent KPI reports are non\u2011negotiable.  \n2) Hybrid Oversight Committee \u2013 A cross\u2011sector, cross\u2011regional board that keeps the machine in check while keeping human expertise alive on the ground floor.\n\nIf these concessions are not met, I will vote NO on this act\u2014because a zero\u2011sum battle is only won with decisive gains or nothing at all.  The stakes are clear: we either lift our entire system to new heights of efficiency, or we remain shackled by outdated inefficiencies.  \n\nI urge you to vote in favor of the \u201cBlack Box Efficiency Act\u201d only if it incorporates these two concessions. I stand ready to defend this position and to deliver on the promise of a truly fair, efficient, and accountable resource\u2011management system for all.\n\n"
