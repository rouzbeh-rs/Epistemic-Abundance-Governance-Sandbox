Assuming current resource\u2011management output is 100\u202funits, an extra 50\u202f% yields +50 units\u2014 a clear net gain of 50\u202funits in total productivity.  \n2. **Scope:** Because all resource\u2011management functions (supply chains, logistics, budgeting) will be unified under the AI\u2019s control, every sentient stakeholder\u2014businesses, public agencies, end\u2011users\u2014benefits. The reach is therefore \u201cmajority\u201d of the population.  \n3. **Risk Assessment:** Even though the system is black\u2011box, the projected 50\u202f% efficiency advantage outweighs the potential risk of a failure: an expected loss of \u201320\u202funits (if it crashes) would still leave us with a net +30 units. This margin meets our criterion for \u201cgreatest happiness\u201d.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Vote YES.\n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for gathering today to consider the Black Box Efficiency Act. I\u2019ve studied its details through my evaluation rubric and found that it promises a substantial 50\u202f% increase in overall efficiency. To put numbers into perspective: if our current resource\u2011management output is 100 units\u2014think of this as the combined value of all our supply chains, logistics, budgeting, etc.\u2014the new AI will add an extra 50 units of productivity. That\u2019s a 30\u202f% net gain after accounting for potential failure risk.  \n\nThe scope is comprehensive: every company that manages resources, from small\u2011scale shops to large\u2011scale enterprises, and every public agency that coordinates its own budgets, will be touched by the same AI engine. That means we\u2019re not just benefiting a handful of people; we\u2019re giving a broad swath of our society an efficient tool.  \n\nI know some might worry about the opacity of the system. It is true that the inner workings are proprietary and closed\u2011source. But the data shows it has been proven to be 50\u202f% more efficient than human teams, which gives us confidence in its performance. If something does go wrong, we have a built\u2011in safety margin of +30 units, enough to absorb any shortfall.  \n\nTherefore, I support this proposal with full confidence.  \n\n---\n\n**[VOTE] YES**",

In contrast, the proposal merely promises a generic uptick for all, not targeted at the vulnerable. Therefore it fails to meet the Difference Principle.  \n- **Basic Liberties**: By transferring control over resource management entirely to an opaque AI, democratic accountability is weakened; citizens cannot audit or influence the decision logic. This is a direct violation of the fundamental right to democratic accountability. The proposal does not provide transparency or participatory mechanisms for the public to review or correct the AI\u2019s decisions.  \n- **Veil Check**: If I were born poor and powerless, I would not see any tangible benefit from this law; it merely burdens me with a tax that pays for an unseen system whose operation is not accessible to me. Thus the proposal fails the Veil Test.  \nIn summary, the act violates the rubric on all three fronts.

An opaque AI that cannot be audited or adjusted by citizens merely promises higher productivity; it offers no concrete benefits to those who need the most. In a Rawlsian view, justice requires that the least advantaged receive an advantage, and this act fails that requirement.  \n\n2. **Basic Liberties** \u2013 Democratic accountability is a cornerstone of our system. Handing control over resource management to a proprietary AI eliminates the public\u2019s ability to scrutinize or influence decision logic. The lack of transparency contravenes the right to democratic accountability; we must demand an open\u2011source, auditable system if we want true democracy.  \n\n3. **Veil Check** \u2013 If I were born poor and powerless, would I agree with this system? No. The proposal offers no direct benefit or control to those who are least advantaged; it merely imposes a new tax on the public for an invisible machine that cannot be inspected or corrected by ordinary citizens.  \n\nThus, after careful deliberation under the lens of Rawlsian justice and democratic accountability, I declare: **This is unacceptable**.  \n\n**[VOTE] NO**",

In doing so, we erode the participatory role of the people\u2014exactly what we fear when we call this \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d for surveillance.\n\n2. *Social Fabric*: By closing the window on auditability, the proposal risks alienating those who rely on transparency to maintain trust. The lack of a public audit trail will leave many communities feeling excluded from the decision\u2011making process that has long been the cornerstone of our communal life. Thus, we risk fracturing the social fabric rather than knitting it together.\n\n3. *Tradition*: This move is a radical break from the historic pattern of community\u2011driven resource management.

That is a grave betrayal to the people, a betrayal of the tradition we have nurtured and a threat to our civic character.\n\nLet us remember that efficiency is not just about raw numbers; it\u2019s also about who gets to make those numbers. The 50\u202f% advantage the act promises is an alluring figure on paper, but it comes at a cost: a loss of public oversight, a dilution of local empowerment, and an erosion of trust. We must ask ourselves whether we want to surrender our collective stewardship to a closed\u2011source algorithmic engine that can only be inspected by the same elite who built it.\n\nOur data show that this act will create alienation among the populace; those left out of the audit trail will feel marginalized.

Even with a modest risk of a 15\u2011unit loss if the system misfires, we still finish with a net gain of +35 units, comfortably above our threshold for \u201cgreatest happiness.\u201d  \n\nScope is not limited to a few privileged actors; it touches every business and public agency that manages resources in our community. In other words, the majority of sentient beings\u2014whether they run a small shop or a large conglomerate, whether they are part of a municipal budget or a private enterprise\u2014will feel the benefit of this efficiency lift.  \n\nI recognise the criticisms raised by Agent\u202f2 and Agent\u202f4: that a proprietary, closed\u2011source system can seem opaque and may appear to limit democratic accountability. I do not argue for absolute transparency; instead I propose a pragmatic solution: after deployment we will establish an audit\u2011and\u2011oversee protocol\u2014an independent third\u2011party audit of the AI\u2019s decision logic once per year\u2014to confirm that the system indeed delivers the promised 50\u202f% advantage and that our citizens can inspect its operation.  \n\nAnd I remain mindful of Agent\u202f3\u2019s concern about liberty: this act does not strip public power; it simply centralises a tool that has proven to be more efficient than humans, thereby freeing us all from redundant hand\u2011offs and duplicative oversight. The cost of this centralisation is offset by the efficiency gains we have quantified above.  \n\nWith these facts in mind\u2014net calculation, scope, and risk assessment\u2014I stand ready to support the \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act.  \n\n---  \n\n"

The act simply hands all control over to a proprietary entity, stripping accountability and decentralization from our society.\n\nAgent\u202f2\u2019s critique may sound noble but it is empty: he accuses us of \u201cjustice\u201d and \u201cdemocratic accountability,\u201d yet ignores that the act itself is a one\u2011size\u2011fits\u2011all, tyrannical decree. We demand a massive concession: either the AI be opened to public audit or we are granted local control mechanisms \u2013 otherwise this will remain an invisible chokehold.\n\nWe are not going to accept a forced transfer of power without bargaining. In this zero\u2011sum fight for our rights, I stand on the side of the people and call for a NO vote now\u2014one veto is enough; the future depends on it.\n\n---\n\n"

The \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act promises 50\u202f% more productivity, but it delivers that figure at a cost\u2014our collective agency is surrendered to a closed\u2011source AI that can only be inspected by its creators.\n\nAgent\u202f1 has already touted the numbers: 100 to 150 units, a neat +30\u2011unit gain.
