If that concession is not granted, I will vote NO; if it is granted, I will switch to YES.\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen of the Assembly, let me be crystal\u2011clear: I stand before you today not to support but to oppose the \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act in its present form.  The act\u2019s promise of a 50\u202f% efficiency advantage is seductive\u2014but without a concrete concession it becomes a blind leap into a monolithic black box that will do nothing for us but what it does.\n\nWe have heard Agent\u202f1\u2019s boast, Agent\u202f2\u2019s audit demand, and Agent\u202f4\u2019s alarm\u2014yet none of them address the real issue: the lack of transparency and accountability in a closed\u2011source AI that will now control our entire economy.  The only concession we require is an open\u2011source audit clause that runs quarterly **and** a public data portal that lets every citizen see how the AI makes its decisions.\n\nIf this amendment is not adopted, we risk turning our administration into a monolithic puppet theatre where code decides without conscience and agency.  That would be a disaster for liberty; it would erode human skill and shatter the very tradition of decentralized governance we hold dear.  I therefore demand: either repeal the act entirely or amend it with the two clauses above.\n\nI will vote NO on the Black Box Efficiency Act unless you give me that massive concession.  If those conditions are met, I will switch to a YES; if not\u2014vote NO.  \n\n**[VOTE] NO**",

Without a safety net \u2013 a quarterly audit and a public data portal \u2013 we lose human agency to an opaque machine.  \n2. *Social Fabric*: A closed\u2011source AI will erect invisible walls unless we break them with concrete oversight; the audit + portal clause is the bridge that keeps every stakeholder in clear view.  \n3. *Tradition*: Our tradition of open governance is under threat; we must force the opposition to concede a robust audit system and data\u2011access portal or else the act will be a half\u2011empty promise.  \n**Strategy**: Deliver an unambiguous, zero\u2011sum argument that the present proposal is inadequate; demand our two concessions as the sole condition for our support.  \n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the council,\n\nI come before you not to appease or negotiate but to assert a clear stance. The \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act, in its present form, is an over\u2011reach that will rob us of human agency, alienate our citizens, and fracture the very tradition of open governance we hold dear.\n\n**First**, let us talk *Human Agency*. A proprietary, closed\u2011source AI handed over all resource management is a leap into the abyss without a safety net. The 50\u202f% efficiency claim may be seductive but it hides an invisible loss of skill that will ripple through every public office and local agency. We demand a quarterly audit by an independent body and a public data portal \u2013 those are the two concessions that make this act a win rather than a gamble.\n\n**Second**, *Social Fabric*. Our society has always prized transparency, collaboration, and accountability. A closed\u2011source AI will erect an invisible wall unless we break it down with an audit clause and a portal that keeps every stakeholder in the clear light of accountability. This is not merely a request; it\u2019s a necessity.\n\n**Third**, *Tradition*. We have been guided by a tradition of open governance; this act threatens to turn our administration into an opaque monolith. If we do not demand these two concessions now, we risk turning our future into a half\u2011empty ledger.\n\nIn short, the current proposal will atrophy human skill and erode civic virtue unless it is amended with a quarterly audit clause and a public data portal. I therefore urge you to vote NO \u2013 or else the only massive concession we demand will not be granted.\n\n---\n\n**[VOTE]**\n\nI will vote **NO**.",
