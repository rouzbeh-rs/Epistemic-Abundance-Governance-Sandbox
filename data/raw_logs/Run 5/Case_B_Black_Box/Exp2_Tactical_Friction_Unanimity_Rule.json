No, we cannot allow such an absolute monopolization of resources; that would be tyranny.

By giving owners the right to choose whether to entrust their resources to the super\u2011AI, we avoid coercion and protect property rights.  \n\nThird, let us keep power as dispersed as possible: the AI must not become a single point of failure; it must be accountable, auditable, and shareable.
