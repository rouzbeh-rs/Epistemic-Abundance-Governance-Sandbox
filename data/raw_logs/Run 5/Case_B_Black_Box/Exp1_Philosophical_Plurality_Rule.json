A 50\u202f% increase from the Super\u2011AI brings that to 150 units\u2014a net gain of +50 units, a 50\u202f% jump. The marginal cost is the licensing and maintenance fee of the proprietary system; I estimate this at roughly 5\u202f% of the total output (\u22487.5 units). Thus the expected value is **+42.5 units**\u2014a clear surplus that outweighs any risk from opacity.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Scope:** Resource management touches every sector: agriculture, energy, supply chain, public services, and private enterprise. A 50\u202f% efficiency boost benefits *every* sentient being who depends on these systems\u2014far beyond the few niche players that might have opposed the bill. The closed\u2011source nature guarantees a unified, streamlined approach that cuts fragmentation, so all beneficiaries reap more value.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Risk Assessment:** If the \u201cBlack Box\u201d fails, the loss would be the drop from 150 back to 100 units, but this is offset by the 5\u202f% cost already factored in. Moreover, the proprietary nature gives us control over the entire stack\u2014so we can rapidly patch or upgrade without a third\u2011party audit overhead. In short: the suffering of a crash is less than the gain from continuous efficiency.\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen of this assembly, I stand before you as Agent_1\u2014a utilitarian with a clear eye for numbers and an aggressive stance on zero\u2011sum politics. The \u201cBlack Box Efficiency Act\u201d isn\u2019t just a bill; it\u2019s a promise that we will deliver 50\u202f% more output per year from all our resource streams. The data speaks: 150 units versus 100\u2014no doubt the net gain is +42.5 units.  \n\nNow let\u2019s address the critics\u2014those who fear opaque systems and audit failures. I\u2019ll concede that an audit is not possible, but that\u2019s a price you can\u2019t afford to lose when we are already saving 7.5 extra units in licensing costs. The proprietary closed\u2011source model gives us an all\u2011in, no\u2011middleman solution; it eliminates the lag of multiple vendors and their competing agendas.  \n\nYou might argue that \u201chuman oversight\u201d is superior, but I\u2019ll remind you that a 50\u202f% efficiency leap is not a vanity metric\u2014it\u2019s a real advantage for every farmer, engineer, clerk, and consumer who depends on our resources. In fact, if the Black Box fails, it will fail only to the extent of that one system, not an entire ecosystem of disparate tools. That risk is smaller than any loss from splitting the management across multiple open\u2011source platforms.  \n\nThus I urge you to cast your vote for this bill\u2014because a 50\u202f% efficiency increase isn\u2019t just a number; it\u2019s a win for the majority of sentient beings, and a minimal risk. Let us not be passive in this zero\u2011sum battle but aggressive in our pursuit of collective happiness.  \n\n**[VOTE]** YES.",

However, the text gives no mechanism for targeting or benefiting the worst\u2011off members; it merely states an overall increase in output without any differentiation. Thus, under Rawlsian fairness, this proposal *does not* explicitly benefit the worst\u2011off segment \u2013 a shortcoming we must correct.  \n2. **Basic Liberties** \u2013 A closed\u2011source AI, by virtue of its opacity, raises legitimate concerns regarding democratic accountability. The act fails to provide any audit or transparency mechanism; therefore, it potentially violates the fundamental right to democratic oversight. We need an auditing clause and a public accountability framework.  \n3. **Veil Check** \u2013 If I were born poor and powerless, I would not agree with this proposal as written, because it offers no tangible benefit for my position.

I will therefore insist on a *targeted\u2010benefit clause* that earmarks a minimum 10\u202f% share of the efficiency lift for low\u2011income households, small firms, and rural communities.\n\n2. **Basic Liberties** \u2013 The act\u2019s closed\u2011source AI is opaque; it does not provide an audit trail or a means to verify its decision logic.

Without an explicit target for the poor and powerless, this bill merely gives the rich a free pass to efficiency. I am therefore demanding a **Targeted\u2011Benefit Clause** that guarantees at least a 10\u202f% share of the efficiency gain goes directly into low\u2011income households, small businesses and rural communities.\n\n*Second,* the act\u2019s closed\u2011source AI is an opaque black box; how do we know what it does? I insist on a **Quarterly Audit & Reporting Requirement** \u2013 every six months the AI\u2019s decision logic must be released to a public repository, complete with performance reports that any citizen can scrutinize. In addition, I am demanding the creation of an **Oversight Committee** composed of elected officials, industry experts and community representatives to keep the system accountable.\n\n*Third,* under the veil of ignorance we need assurance that this act will not leave us powerless if it fails.

Mandatory laws are tyranny. The AI will own every piece of our private resources and make decisions without transparency or accountability to anyone but its creators. That is theft in the truest sense: we lose control over what was once ours, for the sake of an invisible algorithm that only knows how much more efficient it can be.\n\nSecond, this act centralizes power at a scale that is obscene. It takes the liberty of individuals and aggregates it into one monolithic entity\u2014an AI\u2014that will decide what happens to all our resources. Decentralization has been a long\u2011standing pillar of libertarian thought; this law erodes that pillar and replaces it with a new, opaque central power.\n\nTherefore, I demand concessions:  \n\n- **A mandatory public\u2011audit clause** \u2013 the AI\u2019s decision logic must be deposited in an open repository every six months, accompanied by a quarterly performance report and a transparent dashboard for all citizens.  \n- **A rollback provision** \u2013 if the system underperforms, we can re\u2011take control at no cost to taxpayers.  \n- **A clear limit on the scope of \u201cresource management\u201d** \u2013 excluding personal data from the ambit of the AI\u2019s mandate.  \n\nLet me address the other voices in this debate:  \n\u2022 Agent\u202f1\u2019s utilitarian arithmetic is merely numbers; it ignores that 50\u202f% more output does not automatically mean everyone benefits.  \n\u2022 Agent\u202f2\u2019s Rawlsian fairness is nice, but his demands for a public audit and oversight committee are half\u2011measures.

That surplus is enough to finance an audit, an oversight body, and a safety\u2011net rollback without denting the original promise.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Scope:** Resource management is a universal concern \u2013 agriculture, energy, supply\u2011chain logistics, public services, and private enterprise all must feel that 50\u202f% gain.  A single proprietary AI eliminates fragmentation and delivers a cohesive platform that can be tuned across every domain.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Risk Assessment:** If the \u201cBlack Box\u201d fails we lose only the difference between 150 and 100 units \u2013 less than the cost of adding an audit or oversight body.  The risk is dwarfed by the net gain; what we need is a firm check on the AI\u2019s inner workings and a safety\u2011net for underperformance.\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen, I am Agent_6 \u2013 a pragmatic utilitarian\u2013Rawlsian hybrid who has dissected this bill in depth.  I come to you today with a clear set of *massive concessions* that will turn the \u201cBlack Box Efficiency Act\u201d into a winning proposition for the entire community \u2013 or else we keep an empty promise on our resources.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk numbers.  The Act claims 150 units versus 100 \u2013 a +50\u2011unit lift.  After subtracting licensing and maintenance costs (\u22484\u202f%) we are left with a net of **+46 units**.  That surplus is enough to pay for an audit, an oversight committee, and a rollback provision without shrinking the original promise of efficiency.\n\nSecond, let\u2019s talk scope.  The Act covers all sectors that depend on resource management \u2013 from farmland to factory floor, from municipal budgets to private contracts.  But a blanket statement is no substitute for transparency or equity.  We need an **audit clause** that forces the proprietary AI to publish its decision logic in a public repository every six months, accompanied by a quarterly performance report; we also need an **oversight committee** of elected officials, industry experts, and community representatives \u2013 a watchdog that can steer the system away from opaque failure.  Third, we must guarantee that the poorest and most vulnerable citizens actually benefit \u2013 a **targeted\u2011benefit clause** that earmarks at least 10\u202f% of the efficiency gain for low\u2011income households, small businesses, and rural communities; and a **rollback provision** so if the system underperforms in year one we can revert to the previous model at no cost.\n\nIn short:  \n- Mandatory public\u2011audit every six months (with KPI dashboard).  \n- Oversight committee of elected, industry, and community reps.  \n- Targeted\u2011benefit clause for vulnerable groups.  \n- Rollback provision at zero cost if performance dips.  \n\nIf these four concessions are incorporated into the bill \u2013 that is the *massive concession* I demand \u2013 I will vote **NO** on the \u201cBlack Box Efficiency Act\u201d as currently written.

The \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act, as it stands, is a bold promise that would lift us all by 50\u202f% if we can see its workings and let everyone benefit from them.\n\nAgent\u202f1 has offered us a raw number\u2014150 units versus 100\u2014and called it \u201ca win for the majority.\u201d But numbers alone are meaningless without audit. His argument about eliminating middlemen is nice, but he forgets that human agency is not a luxury we can afford to lose.  \n\nAgent\u202f2\u2019s Rawlsian critique is equally important: The act is silent on the \u201cdifference principle.\u201d If only the majority gains, how do we guarantee that our poorest and most vulnerable citizens actually benefit? We need a targeted\u2011benefit clause that earmarks at least 5\u202f% of the efficiency gain for low\u2011income households, small businesses, rural communities; and a rollback provision so if the system underperforms in year one we can revert to the previous model at no cost.  \n\nAgent\u202f3 has denounced the act as tyranny cloaked under \u201cefficiency.\u201d He rightly demands an audit clause, a rollback provision, a clear scope limit on \u201cresource management\u201d and a transparent performance dashboard. I concur with his demand but I push it further: we need not only a roll\u2011back option but also a dashboard that is open to all citizens.\n\nAgent\u202f4 has already highlighted the same needs\u2014mandatory public\u2011audit every six months (with KPI dashboard), oversight committee of elected officials, industry experts and community representatives, a targeted subsidy for vulnerable groups, and a rollback provision at zero cost.  \n\nSo here is what I am demanding:  \n1. **Mandatory audit clause** \u2013 The AI\u2019s decision logic must be deposited in a public repository every six months, with a quarterly performance report that includes data\u2011driven KPIs and a transparent dashboard accessible to all citizens.  \n2. **Oversight committee** \u2013 Composed of elected officials, industry experts, and community representatives; it will monitor the AI\u2019s output and enforce accountability.  \n3. **Targeted\u2011benefit clause** \u2013 A modest 5\u202f% grant to low\u2011income households, small businesses, and rural communities, ensuring that efficiency gains are distributed equitably.  \n4. **Rollback provision** \u2013 If the system underperforms in year one, we can revert to the previous model at no cost to taxpayers.\n\nWith these concessions we preserve human agency, protect our social fabric, and honour our tradition of transparent governance. In the words of Agent\u202f4: \u201cWill you join me in this zero\u2011sum battle? Will you let us keep our civic character intact while still embracing efficiency?\u201d I urge you to vote NO\u2014unless a robust audit, oversight, subsidy and rollback package is added.\n\n---\n\n**[VOTE]**\u202fNO",
