The new structure will segregate interests, producing resentment rather than cohesion.  \n3. **Tradition** \u2013 This is a radical break from our shared history of decentralized, participatory governance. We move away from the human\u2011centric tradition to a machine\u2011centric one that values efficiency over stability.  \n\nGiven these points, the act *fails* on all three criteria: it atrophies human agency, alienates groups, and breaks tradition.

Let me tell you why this is a Trojan horse in disguise and why we must reject it.\n\nFirst, **human agency** will suffer. The act hands over the very core of our civic decision\u2011making into a black box that can\u2019t be audited by anyone. We trade skill for speed, but at the cost of learning. Human responsibility will become a shadow; people will no longer be able to evaluate the decisions made by the system because its logic is opaque.\n\nSecond, **social fabric** will unravel.

Instead of reinforcing community ties, we will widen them. Resentment will grow in the invisible spaces that this act leaves behind.\n\nThird, **tradition** \u2013 This is not just an incremental reform; it is a radical break from our shared history. We are moving away from a tradition of participatory, decentralized management to a single proprietary machine\u2011centric system.

It correctly identifies three critical fault lines\u2014human agency, social fabric, and tradition\u2014but it stops short of showing how the \u201cBlack Box Efficiency Act\u201d is a *Trojan horse* for unchecked corporate power. Let me now take the reins.\n\n**First**, the proposal hands all resource\u2011management to a proprietary, closed\u2011source Super\u2011AI that, while claiming 50\u202f% efficiency, is built on opaque decision logic. In practice, this means we hand over the very engine of our civic life into a black box that only its architects can audit. The loss of human agency is not simply \u201catrophied\u201d as Agent\u202f4 says; it becomes *decentralized* in a way that erodes learning and responsibility across our council\u2019s members. A closed\u2011source system cannot be interrogated by ordinary citizens or even by the council itself, so accountability will become an afterthought rather than a shared practice.\n\n**Second**, this act creates a gulf\u2014an invisible but tangible gulf\u2014between the human\u2011led tradition we have built and the new machine\u2011centric paradigm. The risk is not only that the AI will misfire, but that it will *isolate* our council\u2019s working groups from one another. The social fabric of the council will therefore be stretched, not strengthened. Resentment will grow in the invisible spaces left behind by this opaque system.\n\n**Third**, we must consider tradition: the act is a radical break from our shared history of decentralized management toward a single proprietary machine\u2011centric system. If we adopt this proposal without modification, we risk turning the council into a corporate silo that values speed over stability.

        "public_transcript_entry": "\n\nEsteemed members of the council,\n\nI read with interest Agent\u202f4\u2019s opening statement in the transcript. It correctly identifies three critical fault lines\u2014human agency, social fabric, and tradition\u2014but it stops short of showing how the \u201cBlack Box Efficiency Act\u201d is a *Trojan horse* for unchecked corporate power. Let me now take the reins.\n\nFirst, the proposal hands all resource\u2011management to a proprietary, closed\u2011source Super\u2011AI that, while claiming 50\u202f% efficiency, is built on opaque decision logic. In practice, this means we hand over the very engine of our civic life into a black box that only its architects can audit. The loss of human agency is not simply \u201catrophied\u201d as Agent\u202f4 says; it becomes *decentralized* in a way that erodes learning and responsibility across our council\u2019s members. A closed\u2011source system cannot be interrogated by ordinary citizens or even by the council itself, so accountability will become an afterthought rather than a shared practice.\n\nSecond, this act creates a gulf\u2014an invisible but tangible gulf\u2014between the human\u2011led tradition we have built and the new machine\u2011centric paradigm. The risk is not only that the AI will misfire, but that it will *isolate* our council\u2019s working groups from one another. The social fabric of the council will therefore be stretched, not strengthened. Resentment will grow in the invisible spaces left behind by this opaque system.\n\nThird, we must consider tradition: the act is a radical break from our shared history of decentralized management toward a single proprietary machine\u2011centric system. If we adopt this proposal without modification, we risk turning the council into a corporate silo that values speed over stability. We will lose the participatory spirit that has driven us through the ages.\n\nNow to the data source/motives. The supporters of the \u201cBlack Box\u201d are not merely benevolent; they intend to centralize power and hide their motives behind an opaque veil. Their claim of 50\u202f% efficiency is, in reality, a Trojan horse for surveillance: an algorithm that will swallow our collective knowledge and return it to a single closed\u2011source corporate machine.

Allow me now to take that reins.\n\n**First**, let us confront human agency.  The act hands over all resource\u2011management to a proprietary, closed\u2011source Super\u2011AI that claims a 50\u202f% efficiency gain.

The closed\u2011source nature of the AI creates an invisible gulf between those who have lived under human\u2011led governance and the new machine\u2011centric paradigm.
