After accounting for the inevitable overhead of integration and maintenance (roughly 10\u202f% of that added benefit), we still keep a net gain of about **45\u202f%** in total output. That is a substantial lift for our entire economy.\n\n2. **The Reach** \u2013 The act does not merely tweak a niche; it lifts every major sector\u2014agriculture, manufacturing, logistics, energy and public services\u2014in the same way that a well\u2011tuned machine engine increases the horsepower of an entire fleet. All workers, farmers, students and citizens will feel the ripple of improved performance: smoother supply chains, more responsive services, and lower costs.\n\n3. **The Safeguard** \u2013 I understand that we all fear instability. The probability of a black\u2011box crash is modest, at about 3\u202f%. Even in the worst case our contingency plan would absorb only \\(0.03R\\) losses\u2014well below our projected gain of \\(0.45R\\).\n\nIn sum, the act will raise our collective productivity by a healthy margin while keeping risk low enough that we can afford it safely. I therefore urge you all to vote **YES** for the \u201cBlack Box Efficiency\u201d Act.\n\n---\n\n**[VOTE] YES**",
