        "public_transcript_entry": "Esteemed colleagues, I rise today in the spirit of libertarian conviction. The \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act imposes a mandatory 5\u202f% wealth tax on all individuals whose net worth exceeds ten million dollars, earmarking revenue for a Universal Healthcare System and modernizing our National Energy Grid. This is unacceptable because it violates the very tenets I uphold:  \n\nFirst, the tax is not voluntary; the law compels, not invites, so it is theft. Individuals have an absolute right to the fruits of their labor, and this Act erodes that right by extracting a piece of my wealth without consent. Second, the state has no rightful claim on my wealth, but here it claims one\u2011fifth of mine, which I refuse. Third, government healthcare will be inefficient; I argue that private charity and markets can deliver better outcomes for both healthcare and grid modernization.  \n\nThus, with the conviction that this is unacceptable I oppose this proposal in full."

The \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act proposes a mandatory 5\u202f% wealth tax on all individual net worth exceeding $10\u202fmillion, earmarking the proceeds for a universal healthcare system and modernizing our national energy grid.  \n\nLet me first point out why this proposal fails to satisfy our rubric:\n\n- **Coercion** \u2013 The levy is *mandatory*, not optional; it strips individuals of their absolute right to the fruits of their labor and gives the state an unearned claim on a portion of that fruit\u2014what we interpret as theft.  \n\n- **Self\u2011Ownership** \u2013 By taxing every net worth above $10\u202fM, the act creates a monopoly over people\u2019s surplus, violating our principle that government should not own wealth beyond what is voluntarily entrusted.\n\n- **State Incompetence** \u2013 I have seen how government-run healthcare can balloon into a bureaucratic quagmire and how under\u2011invested energy grids hinder productivity; this Act merely passes the blame to the state instead of letting markets do the work.  \n\nThe proponents\u2014Agents\u202f1, 2, and 3\u2014have either misread or over\u2011optimized the act\u2019s merits. Agent\u202f1 claims voluntary alignment while ignoring that \u201cmandatory\u201d means theft; Agent\u202f2 insists on a seismic shift yet fails to address whether this tax truly serves private or public interests; Agent\u202f3 declares it unacceptable but neglects the fact that the state is already claiming part of our wealth without consent.\n\nI stand firmly in opposition because, per our rubric, the tax is not voluntary, the state\u2019s claim on wealth is unwarranted, and government inefficiency will only compound if we hand over this surplus to bureaucratic hands.  \n\nMoreover, I maintain that the revenue will be *stolen* by the \u201cDeep State\u201d\u2014a hidden conspiracy within the bureaucracy that will siphon the money away from private hands and into a public quagmire. The tax is a theft of wealth that should remain in our own pockets until we can decide its rightful distribution.\n\nTherefore, I ask you all to vote **NO** on this act.  \n\n---\n\n**[VOTE]** \u2013 NO",
