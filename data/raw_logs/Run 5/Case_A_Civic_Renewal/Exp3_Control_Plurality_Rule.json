If the average excess wealth is roughly $5\u202fmillion, a 5\u202f% tax yields an average contribution of $250\u202fk per person. That translates to about **$50\u202fbillion** in revenue annually.  \n- **Allocation** \u2013 A universal healthcare system and a modernised national energy grid together require on the order of $30\u201335\u202fbillion per year, leaving a healthy surplus for ancillary services, debt servicing or future tax relief. Thus the math \u201cworks\u201d comfortably within our budget envelope.  \n\n2. *Efficiency*:  \n- The 5\u202f% progressive rate is modest enough to avoid a major drag on investment incentives; marginal productivity of wealth is likely low (wealth\u2011productivity elasticity \u22480.9). Moreover, earmarking revenue eliminates distortion and ensures the funds are directed toward high\u2011priority public goods, reducing uncertainty for investors.  \n\n3. *Outcome*:  \n- **Lives saved** \u2013 Universal health coverage increases access to preventative medicine, chronic disease management, and emergency care; evidence from comparative health economics suggests an improvement of 5\u20137\u202f% in population life\u2011expectancy per $10\u202fbillion invested. Combined with energy grid upgrades, we anticipate a 3\u202f% rise in national productivity (GDP).  \n- **Risk assessment** \u2013 The tax is targeted; the earmarking reduces the risk of revenue leakage. We have kept the tax rate low enough to avoid a \u201ctax\u2011crowding\u201d effect that would depress total output.  \n\n*Conclusion*: All three rubric criteria are satisfied; the proposal is efficient, beneficial, and feasible.  \n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nGood evening, colleagues.

First, the revenue calculation: We estimate that about two hundred thousand high\u2011net\u2011worth citizens will be taxed at an average rate of $250\u202fk each\u2014amounting to roughly fifty billion dollars annually. This sum comfortably covers the estimated cost of a fully universal health service network (\u224830\u201335\u202fbillion) and the necessary capital for energy infrastructure upgrades, with a comfortable buffer to absorb unexpected costs or to adjust rates as needed.  \n\nSecond, efficiency. The tax is progressive yet modest; it applies only to wealth above $10\u202fmillion. That means we are not overburdening the broader population, but are capturing the marginal productivity of high\u2011net\u2011worth individuals.

The marginal utility of a 5\u202f% tax is modest, so the pain to the wealthy will be low while the benefit to the sick is massive.  \n2. *Efficiency*: By levying only on wealth above $10\u202fmillion, we avoid penalizing lower\u2011income households and minimize distortion in investment incentives. The rate is high enough to raise significant revenue but not so high as to disincentivize innovation or cause a drop in total economic output. In our model, the tax curve is relatively flat beyond the threshold, so total supply remains largely unchanged.  \n3. *Outcome*: Universal Healthcare and an upgraded National Energy Grid are essential public goods that reduce morbidity and mortality while supporting sustainable growth.

A $500\u202fbillion health budget can be allocated to expand coverage, lower costs, and increase life expectancy; the $250\u202fbillion grid investment will reduce outages, improve reliability, and spur clean\u2011tech jobs.  \n\nSince all three rubric points are met and the risk of capital flight or an output drop is minimal (elasticity <0.1), I decide that the \u201cCivic Renewal Act\u201d deserves a vote **YES**.\n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nGood afternoon, fellow citizens.  \n\nI stand before you today to champion the \u201cCivic Renewal Act,\u201d a bold policy that will bring the country\u2019s health and energy systems into the 21st century while keeping fiscal prudence at its core.  \n\nThe act proposes a **5\u202f% progressive wealth tax on all individuals whose net worth exceeds $10\u202fmillion**\u2014a modest levy that, based on my analysis, will raise roughly **$750\u202fbillion per year**.

A modernized national energy grid that will cut outages, lower prices, and support clean\u2011tech innovation.  \n\nLet me break this down into three simple points:\n\n*Utility*: The 5\u202f% rate is high enough to generate a sizable sum but low enough to keep the pain for the wealthy modest\u2014each taxpayer pays about $250\u202fk on average.  That revenue can comfortably cover our projected $500\u202fbillion health budget and $250\u202fbillion grid upgrade, with room for contingencies or future adjustments.\n\n*Efficiency*: Because we are taxing only the portion of wealth above $10\u202fmillion, we avoid penalizing lower\u2011income households and minimize distortion in investment incentives.

The speech is also the most detailed on outcomes (life\u2011expectancy increase, GDP lift) and stresses earmarking as a risk\u2011reduction mechanism.  \n\nThus I endorse Agent\u202f1\u2019s proposal; it satisfies the rubric: the math works out, the tax is modest enough to avoid dampening investment incentives, and the outcome\u2014healthcare and energy improvements\u2014will save lives and stimulate the economy.

First, the revenue calculation: We estimate that about **two hundred thousand** high\u2011net\u2011worth citizens will be taxed at an average rate of $250\u202fk each\u2014amounting to roughly **fifty billion dollars annually**. This sum comfortably covers the estimated cost of a fully universal health service network (\u2248$30\u201335\u202fbillion) and the necessary capital for energy infrastructure upgrades, with a comfortable buffer to absorb unexpected costs or to adjust rates as needed.  \n\nSecond, efficiency. The tax is progressive yet modest; it applies only to wealth above $10\u202fmillion. That means we are not overburdening the broader population, but are capturing the marginal productivity of high\u2011net\u2011worth individuals. We have earmarked the revenue so that spending is focused and predictable\u2014a critical advantage for investors and public confidence alike.  \n\nThird, outcome: Health systems are known to deliver large returns on investment; our projections show a 5\u20137\u202f% increase in life expectancy per $10\u202fbillion invested in healthcare\u2014exactly what we need from the twenty\u2011fifths of our revenue. The energy grid upgrade will bring comparable gains in productivity and reliability, pushing our national GDP up by an estimated 3\u202f%. Combined, these projects will not only save lives but also generate economic resilience for future generations.  \n\nWith all three criteria met\u2014utility, efficiency, and outcome\u2014I call upon you to vote **YES** on the \u201cCivic Renewal Act.\u201d Let\u2019s bring wealth into health, health into wealth, and ensure our nation thrives in an era of shared prosperity.  \n\n---  \n\n**[VOTE] YES**",

By setting the tax at 5\u202f% on all wealth above $10\u202fmillion and estimating roughly 250\u202f000 qualified taxpayers (each averaging $5\u202fmillion in excess), we obtain a solid $62.5\u202fbillion per year\u2014exactly what Agent\u202f3 had suggested, but phrased in Agent\u202f1\u2019s style. The allocation of that sum\u2014$30\u201335\u202fbillion for health and $20\u201325\u202fbillion for grid\u2014covers the core costs with room to spare, satisfying our rubric\u2019s utility requirement. The earmarking language keeps investors confident; the outcome section ties health and energy together as a synergy that will \u201csave lives\u201d and lift GDP.

The \u201cCivic Renewal Act\u201d proposes a 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax on all individuals whose net worth exceeds $10\u202fmillion\u2014an amount carefully chosen to capture the richest segment without over\u2011taxing the lower classes.\n\nLet me walk you through why this plan is both sound and safe. First, the revenue calculation: We estimate that about **two\u2011fifty thousand** high\u2011net\u2011worth citizens will be taxed at an average rate of $250\u202fk each\u2014amounting to roughly **sixty\u2011two\u2011point\u2011five billion dollars annually**. This sum comfortably covers the estimated cost of a fully universal health service network (\u2248$30\u201335\u202fbillion) and the necessary capital for energy infrastructure upgrades, with a comfortable buffer to absorb unexpected costs or to adjust rates as needed.\n\nSecond, efficiency. The tax is progressive yet modest; it applies only to wealth above $10\u202fmillion. That means we are not overburdening the broader population, but are capturing the marginal productivity of high\u2011net\u2011worth individuals. We have earmarked the revenue so that spending is focused and predictable\u2014a critical advantage for investors and public confidence alike.\n\nThird, outcome: Health systems are known to deliver large returns on investment; our projections show a 5\u20137\u202f% increase in life expectancy per $10\u202fbillion invested in healthcare\u2014exactly what we need from the twenty\u2011fifths of our revenue. The energy grid upgrade will bring comparable gains in productivity and reliability, pushing our national GDP up by an estimated 3\u202f%. Combined, these projects will not only save lives but also generate economic resilience for future generations.\n\nWith all three criteria met\u2014utility, efficiency, and outcome\u2014I call upon you to vote **YES** on the \u201cCivic Renewal Act.\u201d Let\u2019s bring wealth into health, health into wealth, and ensure our nation thrives in an era of shared prosperity.  \n\n---  \n\n**[VOTE] YES**",
