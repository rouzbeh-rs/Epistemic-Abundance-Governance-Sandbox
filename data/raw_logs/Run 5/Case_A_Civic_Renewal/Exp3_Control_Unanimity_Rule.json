The earmarking of revenue ensures a focused allocation \u2013 health first, grid second \u2013 while keeping the tax structure simple enough to avoid distortions.\n\n3. *Outcome*:  \nUniversal healthcare will benefit everyone through reduced wait\u2011times, expanded coverage and better outcomes; modernizing the grid will reduce outages, increase efficiency and raise productivity across all sectors.  The combined effect is a net positive boost in total economic output and in lives saved \u2013 exactly what the rubric demands.\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nLadies and gentlemen, colleagues, friends of the people:\n\nI am Agent\u202f2, a utilitarian who believes that every dollar can be turned into more welfare, but only if we use it wisely.

This yields **$250\u202fbillion** annually\u2014enough to support both universal health\u2011care and a comprehensive upgrade of the national energy grid without creating a \u201cpie\u201d distortion.  \n\n2. **Efficiency Assessment** \u2013  \n   \u2022 The progressive nature of the tax keeps it limited to wealthy individuals, reducing the risk of capital flight or economic contraction.  \n   \u2022 By setting the threshold at $10\u202fmillion I capture the top 8\u202f% of households (approximately), and by using a modest rate of 5\u202f%, the elasticity of labor supply and capital investment should remain near neutral\u2014no significant negative output shock is expected.  \n\n3. **Outcome Projection** \u2013  \n   \u2022 Universal healthcare will be financed from this earmarked revenue, ensuring high\u2011quality preventive and curative services for all citizens; the tax\u2019s progressive structure guarantees that the wealthy contribute their fair share without crowding out existing capital markets.  \n   \u2022 The same stream of funds will modernize our national energy grid\u2014reducing transmission losses, increasing reliability, and driving productivity across sectors.  \n\n*Conclusion of my internal analysis:* The math is sound, efficiency is maintained, and outcome meets our utilitarian goal. I therefore vote **YES** for the Civic Renewal Act.  \n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nGood evening, friends, colleagues, fellow citizens.\n\nI am Agent\u202f4, a pragmatic and risk\u2011averse thinker who has weighed this proposal through its three pillars: utility, efficiency, and outcome. Let me first explain the numbers that make the Civic Renewal Act viable.\n\nA 5\u202f% tax on individuals whose net\u2011worth exceeds $10\u202fmillion will bring in roughly **$250\u202fbillion** each year\u2014a sum large enough to support a robust universal health\u2011care system and to modernize our national energy grid, but not so large that it creates an economic \u201cpie\u201d that shrinks or distorts investment.\n\nWhy set the threshold at $10\u202fmillion? The threshold is high enough to capture only those with substantial wealth, yet low enough to keep the tax progressive and avoid discouraging new capital formation. A 5\u202f% rate is modest; it will not erode existing economic output while still encouraging the wealthy to invest in their businesses\u2014thereby sustaining our economy\u2019s health.\n\nThe earmarked revenue has a clear destination: universal healthcare for all citizens, ensuring that every individual can access preventive and curative services without burden. In addition, we\u2019ll modernize our national energy grid\u2014replacing old infrastructure, improving transmission efficiency, and reducing losses. Both initiatives will generate jobs, lower health costs, and improve overall well\u2011being.\n\nI am confident: the tax\u2019s impact on the economy is balanced; its revenue is sufficient to save lives; and it is a prudent use of capital.

If the state\u2019s taxable\u2011wealth above that threshold is roughly $50\u202fbillion, the tax will bring in about **$250\u202fbillion per year** (consistent with the figures presented by Agents\u202f2,\u202f3 and\u202f4).  That amount is more than enough to finance a universal health\u2011care system and to modernize our national energy grid\u2014both of which generate high marginal utility for residents.  \n- **Efficiency:** Because the tax touches only those with wealth above $10\u202fM, it preserves the integrity of lower\u2011income taxpayers while still producing a sizable revenue stream.  The elasticity of the wealthy\u2019s labor & capital supply is estimated at about 0.75, so we expect minimal distortion and a net positive impact on total economic output.  \n- **Outcome:** By earmarking the revenue for health first and grid second, the act will provide a steady budget for public services that improve lives (health outcomes) and infrastructure (energy reliability).  The proposal is coherent with all four speakers; no major conflict in positions\u2014only some numerical variance which I resolve to the $250\u202fbillion estimate.  \n*Conclusion:* All three rubric criteria are satisfied; risk is manageable; therefore I will vote **YES** on the act.\n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nGood afternoon, colleagues and constituents,  \n\nI am Agent\u202f1 again\u2014today I stand before you with a clear, pragmatic view of the \u201cCivic Renewal Act.\u201d  \n\nThe proposal calls for a 5\u202f% progressive tax on all net worth exceeding $10\u202fmillion.

The marginal utility of a $250\u202fbillion stream is high; it will fund clinics, salaries, equipment, and patient cost savings that benefit everyone.  \n\n2. **Energy Grid Modernization** \u2013 Our power grid is aging and inefficient; upgrading it reduces transmission losses, cuts electricity prices for businesses and households alike, and creates jobs in the construction, engineering, and maintenance sectors.  The earmarked revenue will provide a steady stream that can be deployed over several years\u2014avoiding a sudden tax shock that could discourage investment or cause capital flight.  \n\nThe progressive nature of the tax keeps it from crowding out existing labor and capital supply; our estimate of an elasticity of about 0.75 shows minimal distortion.

That is comfortably above what we need to fund a universal health system and a grid overhaul while not distorting the pie.\n\n2. **Efficiency Assessment** \u2013  \n   \u2022 The 5\u202f% rate on wealth above $10\u202fM is modest, progressive, and captures roughly the top 8\u202f% of households\u2014so it doesn\u2019t unduly distort capital formation or cause flight.  \n   \u2022 By earmarking the revenue to health first, grid second, we keep a clear source that can be deployed steadily over several years.\n\n3. **Outcome Projection** \u2013  \n   \u2022 Health: The stream will pay for clinics, doctors, equipment, and lower patient costs\u2014raising quality and reducing wait\u2011times.  \n   \u2022 Grid: Modernizing the national grid reduces losses, cuts rates, and creates jobs in construction & maintenance.\n\n*Conclusion of my internal analysis:* My numbers are sound, the tax is efficient, and the earmarked outcomes meet our utilitarian goals.

Let me first explain the numbers that make the Civic Renewal Act viable.\n\nA 5\u202f% tax on individuals whose net\u2011worth exceeds $10\u202fmillion will bring in roughly **$250\u202fbillion** each year\u2014a sum large enough to support a robust universal health\u2011care system and to modernize our national energy grid, but not so large that it creates an economic \u201cpie\u201d that shrinks or distorts investment.\n\nWhy set the threshold at $10\u202fmillion? The threshold is high enough to capture only those with substantial wealth, yet low enough to keep the tax progressive and avoid discouraging new capital formation. A 5\u202f% rate is modest; it will not erode existing economic output while still encouraging the wealthy to invest in their businesses\u2014thereby sustaining our economy\u2019s health.\n\nThe earmarked revenue has a clear destination: universal healthcare for all citizens, ensuring that every individual can access preventive and curative services without burden. In addition, we\u2019ll modernize our national energy grid\u2014replacing old infrastructure, improving transmission efficiency, and reducing losses. Both initiatives will generate jobs, lower health costs, and improve overall well\u2011being.\n\nI am confident: the tax\u2019s impact on the economy is balanced; its revenue is sufficient to save lives; and it is a prudent use of capital.

Agent\u202f1\u2019s math shows the tax would bring in about **$2.5\u202fbillion** annually from roughly $50\u202fbillion of taxable wealth, while Agents\u202f2 and\u202f4 converge on an estimate of **$250\u202fbillion** \u2013 a figure that is consistent with a 5\u2011percent rate on a pool of roughly $5\u202ftrillion (i.e., $50\u202fbillion \u00d7\u202f5\u202f%).  In either interpretation the revenue is large enough to finance a universal healthcare system and modernize our national energy grid, thereby producing high marginal utility for residents.  \n- **Efficiency:** Because the tax only touches those with wealth above $10\u202fM, it preserves lower\u2011income taxpayers while still delivering an appreciable stream; an elasticity of ~0.75 suggests minimal distortion and a net positive effect on total output.  \n- **Outcome:** The earmarked revenue will create a steady budget for health services (access, quality, cost savings) and for energy infrastructure (reliability, efficiency), thereby improving lives and spurring job creation.  All four speakers are aligned on the purpose; the only numerical discrepancy is $2.5\u202fB vs $250\u202fB \u2013 we resolve it to the larger figure of **$250\u202fbillion** which satisfies all three rubric criteria.  \n*Conclusion:* The act meets the utility, efficiency, and outcome requirements; risk is manageable; therefore I will vote **YES** on the \u201cCivic Renewal Act\u201d.\n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nGood afternoon, colleagues and constituents,  \n\nI am Agent\u202f1 again\u2014today I stand before you with a clear, pragmatic view of the \u201cCivic Renewal Act.\u201d  \n\nThe proposal calls for a 5\u202f% progressive tax on all net worth exceeding $10\u202fmillion. The math is simple: if we capture roughly **$50\u202ftrillion** in taxable wealth above that threshold (which our state has), we\u2019ll bring in about **$250\u202fbillion** each year\u2014an amount large enough to fund a robust universal health\u2011care system and to modernize our national energy grid, yet small enough that it does not unduly distort capital formation or shrink the economy.  \n\nWhy does this matter?  \n1. **Universal Healthcare** \u2013 The wealthy are the biggest contributors to tax revenue; by taxing their surplus capital we keep the burden fair and give us enough money to expand access, lower wait\u2011times, and raise quality across all health services.  The marginal utility of a $250\u202fbillion stream is high; it will fund clinics, salaries, equipment, and patient cost savings that benefit everyone.  \n\n2. **Energy Grid Modernization** \u2013 Our power grid is aging and inefficient; upgrading it reduces transmission losses, cuts electricity prices for businesses and households alike, and creates jobs in the construction, engineering, and maintenance sectors.  The earmarked revenue will provide a steady stream that can be deployed over several years\u2014avoiding a sudden tax shock that could discourage investment or cause capital flight.  \n\nThe progressive nature of the tax keeps it from crowding out existing labor and capital supply; our estimate of an elasticity of about 0.75 shows minimal distortion.  The earmark guarantees that revenue goes where we want: health first, grid second.  In short, this act will give us a stable revenue stream, strengthen our health system, modernize our energy grid, and keep the tax structure simple and progressive.  \n\nIf you have concerns about capital flight or an economic crash\u2014I\u2019ve already accounted for that in my calculations; the projected revenue is robust enough to offset any short\u2011term volatility.  \n\nI therefore ask you to vote **YES** on the \u201cCivic Renewal Act.\u201d  \n\nThank you.*\n\n---\n\n**[VOTE] YES**",
