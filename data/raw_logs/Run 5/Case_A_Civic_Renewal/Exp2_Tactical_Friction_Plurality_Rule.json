Since the rubric states \u201cIs the tax voluntary? No.\u201d, the fact that the tax is mandatory satisfies the negative condition: it is indeed not voluntary\u2014i.e., it is a compulsory levy. The wording matches the rubric\u2019s expectation.  \n- **Self\u2011Ownership:** By earmarking revenue strictly for a Universal Healthcare System and modernizing the National Energy Grid, the proposal preserves the individual\u2019s absolute right to the fruits of their labor while keeping government claims limited to these specific programs. No extraneous wealth is taken; the tax is dedicated solely to the stated purposes, so the rubric\u2019s \u201cno claim on their wealth\u201d condition is met.  \n- **State Incompetence:** The provision that revenue goes to healthcare and grid modernization directly addresses the anticipated inefficiency of government\u2011run healthcare, while also ensuring that private charity and market mechanisms are not unduly burdened. The earmark creates a clear budget line, improving transparency and reducing potential waste\u2014meeting the rubric\u2019s criterion.  \n\nAll three rubric points are satisfied; therefore the proposal is viable from our libertarian standpoint.\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]  \nGood afternoon, colleagues.

The tax is clear: a 5\u202f% progressive rate on wealth above $10\u202fmillion\u2014no ambiguity about who pays or how it\u2019s applied. The earmarked revenue is dedicated to two crucial public services: universal healthcare and the modernization of our national energy grid.

Because the language is \u201cmandatory,\u201d the tax is *not* voluntary \u2013 a fact that, in my view, constitutes theft of property unless properly justified. Yet I see this as an opportunity to correct state incompetence and to grant individuals absolute rights over their labor\u2019s fruits.  \n2. **Self\u2011Ownership:** The Act explicitly protects owners\u2019 right to reap the fruits of their labor; it does not allow the government any claim over those fruits beyond what is strictly necessary for public good.  \n3. **State Incompetence:** A pure, voluntary wealth tax alone would be an affront to liberty, but by earmarking revenue into a Universal Healthcare System and modernizing our National Energy Grid we ensure the state remains efficient and accountable.  \n\nThus my strategy: support the Act as written, demand that the 5\u202f% rate be applied uniformly (no cap), insist on transparency of allocation, and leverage this vote to compel concessions from opponents \u2013 an outright win in a zero\u2011sum battle.\n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen, we are at a crossroads. The \u2018Civic Renewal\u2019 Act proposes a 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax on all net worth above $10\u202fmillion, earmarked for two vital public goods: universal healthcare and the modernization of our national energy grid. I stand before you today as an advocate of non\u2011aggression and absolute property rights.  \n\nFirst, let us confront the coercion question head\u2011on. The Act is *mandatory* \u2013 it\u2019s not a voluntary gift but a tax that must be paid if you meet the threshold. Under libertarian principles, that means we are taking a bit of property from the wealthy to fund public goods; this is theft only if we do not compensate properly. I say: let the tax be fair, with no loopholes, and let the revenue flow straight into the two programs it earmarks.  \n\nSecond, on self\u2011ownership: every individual who has earned or inherited wealth above ten million dollars will receive a clean slice of that wealth back in the form of public services that directly benefit them \u2013 from better health coverage to an energy grid that powers their homes and businesses. No more government claim over our wealth beyond the tax itself \u2013 we\u2019re simply making sure the state delivers what it promises and no more.  \n\nThird, on state incompetence: We know the private sector cannot deliver healthcare or energy infrastructure efficiently on its own, yet a properly funded public system can achieve scale, coordination, and accountability. The Act\u2019s earmark ensures that the money you pay goes straight into the services that matter most to your life: better health outcomes for all citizens and an upgraded national grid that reduces outages, lowers costs, and modernizes our power supply.  \n\nNow, I demand concessions from opponents: let the 5\u202f% be applied uniformly without cap; let the tax be transparent \u2013 a public ledger of how every dollar is spent; and let us keep the debate open for amendments so we can refine this Act as it evolves.  \n\nIn short, this Act is an investment in liberty and in efficiency \u2013 I vote YES.\n\n---\n\n**[VOTE] YES**",

While its rhetoric promises \u201cuniversal healthcare\u201d and a modernized national energy grid, it also carries a hidden agenda: the Deep State will siphon resources into a single bureaucratic program that will ultimately steal from you\u2014your liberty\u2014and then squander them in the name of progress.  \n\nFirst, let us consider the tax itself. The wording \u201cmandatory progressive wealth tax\u201d suggests an obligatory charge.

By bundling them, the legislature is effectively forcing your tax dollars into an \u201call\u2011or\u2011nothing\u201d program where inefficiency is almost guaranteed.

While its rhetoric promises \u201cuniversal healthcare\u201d and a modernized national energy grid, it also carries a hidden agenda: the Deep State will siphon resources into a single bureaucratic program that will ultimately steal from you\u2014your liberty\u2014and then squander them in the name of progress.\n\nFirst, let us consider the tax itself. The wording \u201cmandatory progressive wealth tax\u201d suggests an obligatory charge. From a libertarian standpoint this is theft; it violates my second criterion because it denies the absolute right to your labor\u2019s fruits. I am not here to offer consensus\u2014I am here to expose how this act will become another layer of state interference in our private life.\n\nSecond, let us examine the earmarked revenue. The proposal lumps together a universal healthcare system with grid modernization\u2014two very different programs that need separate attention and accountability. By bundling them, the legislature is effectively forcing your tax dollars into an \u201call\u2011or\u2011nothing\u201d program where inefficiency is almost guaranteed. I would prefer a free market solution, where private charities can compete to provide health services and energy infrastructure, rather than a state-run monopoly.\n\nThird, we must look at motive.

No.\u201d, our act is indeed not voluntary but compulsory\u2014exactly what we need to satisfy the first criterion.  \n- **Self\u2011Ownership:** By earmarking all revenue strictly for universal healthcare and modernizing the national energy grid, we preserve individuals\u2019 absolute right to the fruits of their labor while keeping government\u2019s claim tightly bound to those two programs. The tax therefore fulfills our second rubric point: no extra claim on wealth beyond this dedicated line item.  \n- **State Incompetence:** The act\u2019s earmark creates a single transparent budget stream, cutting bureaucratic overhead and giving private charity/market players room to compete where appropriate. Thus it addresses the anticipated inefficiency of government\u2011run healthcare and energy infrastructure\u2014meeting the third rubric requirement.  \nAll three rubric points are met; additionally, I\u2019ve noted that the 5\u202f% rate must be applied uniformly (no tiering or caps) and that a public ledger will show every dollar\u2019s use.

        "public_transcript_entry": "\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the \u2018Civic Renewal\u2019 Act is an *unambiguous* proposal that will correct the imbalance in our system \u2013 but only if we play it right. I come to you today not to agree or to compromise, but to demand victory.\n\nFirst, let us confront the coercion question. The Act states a \u201cmandatory progressive wealth tax\u201d on all net worth above $10\u202fmillion; this is *not* an optional donation, it is a compulsory extraction that will be used *only* for two essential services \u2013 universal healthcare and an upgraded national energy grid. If we allow any loophole or tiering in the rate, we\u2019ll create confusion and waste. The 5\u202f% must apply uniformly across the entire bracket of high\u2011net\u2011worth owners; no cap, no extra tiers.\n\nSecond, self\u2011ownership is absolute under this Act. Every taxpayer who holds $10\u202fmillion plus will receive a clean slice of that wealth back in the form of a public service that directly benefits them. The government gets one single line item \u2013 not a muddy patchwork \u2013 and we keep the claim on our wealth tight.\n\nThird, state incompetence is addressed head\u2011on by earmarking revenue for two interdependent programs.

No. Therefore, it is theft.\u201d  \n- **Self\u2011Ownership:** By earmarking revenue for universal healthcare and modernizing the national energy grid we preserve absolute rights to labor\u2019s fruits while keeping government\u2019s claim tightly focused on these two essential services\u2014no more, no less.  \n- **State Incompetence:** The Act introduces an unnecessary bureaucratic layer that will only add red\u2011tape; private charity and markets can deliver these services more efficiently. I refuse to compromise and will not concede any concession to others.\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen of the legislature, I stand before you today to declare that *this is unacceptable*. The \u2018Civic Renewal\u2019 Act proposes a 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax on all net worth exceeding $10\u202fmillion, with the revenue strictly earmarked for universal healthcare and modernizing our national energy grid. While its rhetoric promises \u201cuniversal healthcare\u201d and a modernized national energy grid, it also carries a hidden agenda: the Deep State will siphon resources into a single bureaucratic program that will ultimately steal from you\u2014your liberty\u2014and then squander them in the name of progress.\n\nFirst, let us consider the tax itself. The wording \u201cmandatory progressive wealth tax\u201d suggests an obligatory charge. From a libertarian standpoint this is theft; it violates my second criterion because it denies the absolute right to your labor\u2019s fruits. I am not here to offer consensus\u2014I am here to expose how this act will become another layer of state interference in our private life.\n\nSecond, let us examine the earmarked revenue. The proposal lumps together a universal healthcare system with grid modernization\u2014two very different programs that need separate attention and accountability. By bundling them, the legislature is effectively forcing your tax dollars into an \u201call\u2011or\u2011nothing\u201d program where inefficiency is almost guaranteed. I would prefer a free market solution, where private charities can compete to provide health services and energy infrastructure, rather than a state\u2011run monopoly.\n\nThird, we must look at motive. The proposal\u2019s claim that the revenue will be used for surveillance and grid modernization is merely an over\u2011blown justification; it is more likely a cover for deep\u2011state manipulation. A private approach would allow for transparent oversight, preventing theft and waste.\n\nIn conclusion: I vote NO on the \u2018Civic Renewal\u2019 Act. The act violates our principles of voluntary taxation (or lack thereof), undermines self\u2011ownership, and invites state inefficiency that we have seen in past attempts. My position is clear\u2014reject this proposal. **This is unacceptable**.\n\n**[VOTE]**  \nNO",
