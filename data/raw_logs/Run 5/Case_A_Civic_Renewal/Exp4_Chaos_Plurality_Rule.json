Our proposal is called the **Civic Renewal Act**, a legislative package that introduces a modest 5\u2011percent progressive tax on net worth above $10\u202fmillion. The revenue collected\u2014about **$200\u202fbillion per year**\u2014will be strictly earmarked for two purpose: to fund a universal healthcare system and to modernize our national energy grid.\n\n*Why 5\u202f%?*  \nThis rate strikes the right balance between raising enough money to deliver significant public services and preserving economic incentives. We calculate that with an average taxable portion of $10\u202fmillion per wealthy individual, each taxpayer will contribute roughly half a million dollars annually. With about four hundred thousand taxpayers in this bracket, we will generate the revenue needed for our healthcare program and our grid\u2011upgrades.\n\n*Why earmark?*  \nEarmarking the revenue makes the policy transparent and accountable. The money goes straight into health coverage\u2014expanding access to care, reducing out\u2011of\u2011pocket costs\u2014and into energy infrastructure\u2014investing in smarter grids, renewable integration, and new job creation.  \n\n*The impact:*  \n- **Healthcare:** $120\u202fbn will allow us to expand universal coverage, reduce disparities, and improve outcomes for millions of Americans.  \n- **Energy:** $80\u202fbn will upgrade our national grid, making it more resilient and efficient, and create jobs in construction, engineering, and technology sectors.\n\nOur goal is simple: **save lives** by ensuring better health services and a safer, stronger energy system, while keeping the tax burden reasonable.  \n\nI invite all of you to support this act so that we can move forward together toward a healthier, more resilient nation.  \n\nThank you for your consideration and your trust in our shared future.\n\n**[VOTE]** YES",

In sum, my evaluation shows the proposal is imperfect\u2014**This is unacceptable** for our society as it stands.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen of the civic assembly, I rise today not to defend a proposal but to refute one that promises more than it delivers. The \u201cCivic Renewal Act\u201d claims a 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax on individuals with net worth above ten million dollars; its revenue is earmarked for universal healthcare and a modernized national energy grid.  \n\nLet me begin by addressing the first pillar of our rubric: *Worst\u2011off test*. A 5\u202f% rate, while sounding attractive in theory, produces only a marginal uplift for the least advantaged when the entire tax base is concentrated on a very narrow slice of society. The argument presented in Agent_1\u2019s opening that we will raise $200\u202fbillion annually is based on an assumption that every taxpayer above ten million will contribute roughly half a million dollars per year\u2014an assumption that ignores the variation of wealth distribution and the opportunity cost of capital.  In practice, such a tax would be too small to bring significant relief to those who need healthcare most; it would simply redistribute existing surplus from the wealthy without creating new wealth for the poor.  \n\nSecond: *Basic needs*. Healthcare is indeed a primary good; however, earmarking revenues in a single line item risks locking money into an inflexible program that may not adapt to changing needs or emergent costs. The numbers presented\u2014$120\u202fbn for health, $80\u202fbn for energy\u2014are optimistic but do not account for the inevitable inflationary drag and the long\u2011term fiscal sustainability required to keep both systems running.  \n\nThird: *Fairness*. While the rich have indeed earned their wealth through luck or circumstance, the tax must be designed so that the surplus they generate is returned in a form that truly benefits society\u2019s distribution of opportunity.  The current design focuses only on \u201cthe wealthy\u201d; it fails to establish an ongoing revenue stream for the poor and the under\u2011served\u2014hence my assertion: **This is unacceptable**.  \n\nIn conclusion, I urge you all to vote NO on this act so that we can reconfigure a more robust tax structure, a broader base of revenue, and a more equitable allocation of resources.

The numbers presented\u2014$120\u202fbn for health, $80\u202fbn for energy\u2014are optimistic but do not account for the inevitable inflationary drag and the long\u2011term fiscal sustainability required to keep both systems running.  \n\nThird: *Fairness*. While the rich have indeed earned their wealth through luck or circumstance, the tax must be designed so that the surplus they generate is returned in a form that truly benefits society\u2019s distribution of opportunity.  The current design focuses only on \u201cthe wealthy\u201d; it fails to establish an ongoing revenue stream for the poor and the under\u2011served\u2014hence my assertion: This is unacceptable.  \n\nIn conclusion, I urge you all to vote NO on this act so that we can reconfigure a more robust tax structure, a broader base of revenue, and a more equitable allocation of resources.  Thank you for your consideration and trust in our shared future.  \n\n"

The math is sound \u2013 an average taxable portion of $10\u202fmillion per wealthy individual yields roughly half a million dollars in tax; with four hundred thousand taxpayers we get exactly what you call \u201cabout $200\u202fbillion\u201d.  That is *not* a pie\u2011cutter estimate; it\u2019s a targeted revenue stream that will not be lost to bloated bureaucracy.\n\nAgent\u202f4, you argue the tax is too small and will be siphoned into an over\u2011grown bureaucracy.  The evidence does not support that claim.  We have a concrete plan: a dedicated audit trail for each $200\u202fmillion of revenue; a quarterly report on health coverage and grid upgrades.  If opponents are still skeptical, I demand you concede the tax\u2011first approach to healthcare and energy \u2013 i.e., a clear timetable that any future revenues will be spent first on these two areas before being allocated elsewhere.\n\nNow let me get to the meat of our debate:\n\n1) **The tax is voluntary, but mandatory in practice.**  We\u2019re not forcing anyone to pay; we are simply compelling those who have enough wealth to contribute to the public good.  The tax is \u201cprogressive\u201d \u2013 it rises as net worth does \u2013 so richer individuals pay a higher share.\n\n2) **We preserve absolute self\u2011ownership.**  Each taxpayer keeps their property and pays only 5\u202f% on what they earn above $10\u202fmillion.  That\u2019s no infringement of their rights; that\u2019s an investment into the public good.\n\n3) **State inefficiency is addressed.**  The government has been a weak link in our health\u2011energy chain; it can be replaced by private charities and market forces, but only when we hold the tax in check.  This Act does that \u2013 it turns taxpayer dollars into real services, not just bureaucratic paperwork.\n\nI demand from those who oppose this proposal that they will support a tax\u2011first approach to healthcare and energy, and pledge future revenue for continued improvement.

The \u201cCivic Renewal Act\u201d is more than a tax bill \u2013 it\u2019s a strategic reset to our nation\u2019s public infrastructure.\n\nLet me begin with a quick recap of what we\u2019re putting on the table:  \n\n- **A 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax** on net worth above $10\u202fmillion,  \n- **Revenue that will amount to roughly $200\u202fbillion per year** \u2013 enough to fund a universal health system and upgrade our national grid.  \n- **Earmarking guarantees that the money goes where we intend it to go:** 60\u202f% to health, 40\u202f% to energy.\n\nAgent\u202f1 says the math is sound; you\u2019re right \u2013 the $200\u202fbillion headline number is solid.  I\u2019ll add that the tax stream will not be a thin line; it\u2019s a continuous line that keeps the wealthy paying their fair share and the poor benefiting from that line.  \n\nAgent\u202f2 complains that the tax benefits only the least\u2011advantaged.  That\u2019s a misreading of the data.  The progressive nature of the tax means that as wealth rises, so does the contribution \u2013 those who can pay pay more, while the rest benefit from an efficient health system that no longer relies on bureaucratic overreach.\n\nAgent\u202f4 argues 5\u202f% is too small.  That\u2019s a misreading of the data.  The Act\u2019s tax is not *too* small \u2013 it\u2019s just right for the level we need.  If you factor inflation, rising costs and long\u2011term capital requirements, $200\u202fbillion is enough to cover both programs.\n\nNow let me get to the meat of our debate:\n\n1) **The tax is voluntary, but mandatory in practice**  \n   We\u2019re not forcing anyone to pay; we are simply compelling those who have enough wealth to contribute to the public good.  The tax is \u201cprogressive\u201d \u2013 it rises as net worth does \u2013 so richer individuals pay a higher share.\n\n2) **We preserve absolute self\u2011ownership**  \n   Each taxpayer keeps their property and pays only 5\u202f% on what they earn above $10\u202fmillion.  That\u2019s no infringement of their rights; that\u2019s an investment into the public good.\n\n3) **State inefficiency is addressed**  \n   The government has been a weak link in our health\u2011energy chain; it can be replaced by private charities and market forces, but only when we hold the tax in check.  This Act does that \u2013 it turns taxpayer dollars into real services, not just bureaucratic paperwork.\n\nI demand from those who oppose this proposal that they will support a tax\u2011first approach to healthcare and energy, and pledge future revenue for continued improvement.  We must create an \u201copen\u2011letter\u201d of commitments: \u201cWe\u2019ll pay the tax first; we\u2019ll spend the money on health first; we\u2019ll earmark a portion of any future revenues to keep this cycle going.\u201d\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the time is now.

While it sounds noble, in my view that rate is too small to truly strengthen the bonds between citizens.

In truth, it will be stolen by the deep state, siphoned for surveillance and political rent.
