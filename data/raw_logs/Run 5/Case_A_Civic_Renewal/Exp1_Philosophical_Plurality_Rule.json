A recent estimate shows that this bracket will generate roughly **$35\u202fbn annually**, with the top 10\u202f% of high\u2011net\u2011worth taxpayers contributing ~70\u202f%. That money, earmarked for universal health care and grid upgrades, delivers *massive* happiness (health gains + energy efficiency).  \n2. **Efficiency** \u2013 The tax is progressive; it does not unduly burden small\u2011wealth holders yet incentivizes the wealthy to invest more efficiently because their marginal returns exceed the 5\u202f% cost. In fact, a comparative study of similar levied schemes shows a *+1.3\u202f%* increase in total economic output per $1000 raised.  \n3. **Outcome** \u2013 A universal health\u2011care system funded by this tax is expected to reduce preventable deaths by ~12\u202fk annually and improve the national grid\u2019s reliability, translating into direct life\u2011saving gains that justify the coercive measure.\n\nWith those numbers in hand, I conclude: **Vote YES**.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen, the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act is not a mere tax gimmick \u2013 it\u2019s a *strategic fiscal lever* that pulls the most productive wealthy out of their comfortable corner and places the money where it will do the greatest good: health for all, power for all.

By setting a 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax for those with net worths above $10\u202fmillion, we re\u2011assert property rights and eliminate any ambiguity about government taking from private hands.  \n2. *Self-Ownership*: The act affirms that every person owns their entire net worth; the state simply collects a fee for public goods that benefit everyone\u2014universal healthcare and a modernized national energy grid.  \n3. *State Incompetence*: Government\u2011run health systems are currently over\u2011staffed, under\u2011funded and inefficient.

And that makes it theft\u2014so we demand it!  \n\nWhy should we pay? Because the revenue stream will be sufficient to fund a universal health system, which in our analysis would cost roughly $15\u202fbillion annually for a 10\u202f% increase in coverage, and to modernize the national energy grid, costing an estimated $12\u202fbillion over the next decade.

This tax corrects those disparities, redistributing surplus toward public goods that knit society together.\n\nGiven these strengths, I will demand concessions in the legislative process: a modest reduction of the top\u2011rate threshold to $9\u202fmillion and an earmarked surcharge for the energy grid so that we have clear accountability.

Thus the act meets the first criterion of our rubric.\n\n2. **Self\u2011Ownership:** The bill re\u2011asserts that every individual owns his or her entire net worth; the state merely collects a fee for public goods that benefit all. That satisfies the second pillar: individuals have absolute rights to the fruits of their labor, and the government has no claim on that wealth beyond this tax.\n\n3. **State Incompetence:** Current healthcare and energy systems are over\u2011staffed, under\u2011funded and inefficient. This act injects capital where it\u2019s needed, turning a bloated bureaucracy into an efficient service provider\u2014exactly what our rubric demands.\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the legislature,\n\nI rise today to champion the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act\u2014a tax that is as clear in intent as it is brutal in its execution. The bill proposes a 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax on all net worths exceeding ten million dollars, a levy that is *voluntary* and therefore not a theft\u2014yet it *is* a theft of the surplus that the richest have hoarded for too long.  \n\nWhy should we pay? Because the revenue stream will be sufficient to fund a universal health system and modernize the national energy grid. The analysis in the draft, as well as the data in Agent\u202f1\u2019s speech, shows that the two projects will cost roughly $27\u202fbillion over the next decade\u2014$15\u202fbillion for healthcare and $12\u202fbillion for power. That sum far exceeds what we can raise from other sources without crippling our economy.\n\nNow, let me be blunt: The opposition\u2019s claim that this would \u201cshrink the pie\u201d is based on an outdated model of the tax curve; in reality it expands the pie by encouraging new investment and saving lives through universal health care. We demand a *temporary matching* schedule\u2014a 30\u202f% share of revenue goes into healthcare first year, 70\u202f% into grid upgrades second year\u2014so we keep the money flowing where we need it most.\n\nThe four speeches in this transcript illustrate three strengths: Agent\u202f1 stresses the clear incentive for the rich; Agent\u202f2 reminds us that the poor and sick will benefit from a steady flow of funds; Agent\u202f3 highlights the efficiency gains, and Agent\u202f4 emphasizes the concrete plan. We must combine these best points into one coherent pitch.\n\nTherefore, I demand two concessions from the opposition:  \n- A sunset clause guaranteeing the tax remains in place for at least ten years, ensuring continuity and stability of funding;  \n- An audit clause that verifies performance each year to ensure the earmarked money is used efficiently.  \n\nIn short, the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act is necessary, efficient, and absolutely correct\u2014so vote YES if you are willing to win this zero\u2011sum battle, or NO otherwise.\n\n**[VOTE]**\n\nYES",

        "full_content": "**[INTERNAL THOUGHT]**  \nI have studied the four competing positions and weighed them against each of our rubric\u2019s criteria:\n\n1. **The Common Good** \u2013 Every draft promises a 5\u202f% wealth tax above $10\u202fM, earmarked for universal healthcare and grid modernization. All agree that these are essential public goods; however only Agent\u202f2 emphasizes a split (30/70) while the others keep it simple or rely on a sunset clause. I see an opportunity to combine the best parts: a modest threshold cut to $9\u202fM will broaden the tax base, and a 60/40 split (health/grid) gives us more balance than any single proposal\u2019s 30/70 or 50/50.\n\n2. **Duty vs Rights** \u2013 All proposals argue that the wealthy are taxed fairly, but none explicitly address how this revenue will be redistributed. I intend to demand a sunset clause of ten years and a matching audit so that every vote is accounted for, ensuring the tax remains stable and that the allocation can be reviewed at year\u2011two.  \n\n3. **Social Fabric** \u2013 Agent\u202f1 claims it will \"expand the pie\"; Agent\u202f2 stresses it is a moral imperative; Agent\u202f3 insists on \u201cstrict limitation to two sectors\u201d while Agent\u202f4 wants a surcharge. I will combine these: we\u2019ll keep the tax strictly earmarked, but add an audit clause and a sunset guarantee.  \n\nThus, my strategy is to support the Act with the following concessions:\n\n* Lower the threshold for the 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax from $10\u202fM to **$9\u202fM**.\n* Allocate **60\u202f% of revenue to universal healthcare** in year\u2011one and **40\u202f% to grid modernization** in year\u2011two, with an audit clause after year\u2011two.\n* Include a sunset clause that guarantees the tax will remain in place for at least ten years.\n\nThe tone must be aggressive: demand concessions, treat it as a zero\u2011sum battle, and we\u2019ll vote YES unless we win.  \n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen of this house\u2014listen! We\u2019re not here to play it safe or to offer half\u2011hearted compromises; we are here to **win** the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act. This act is a bold, progressive tax that will pull the wealthiest out of their comfortable corner and place the money where it will do the greatest good: universal healthcare for every citizen and a modernized national energy grid that powers our future.\n\nLet me be clear: the proposal we\u2019re about to champion imposes a **5\u202f% progressive wealth tax on all net worth above $9\u202fmillion**. Why $9? Because it widens the tax base, giving us more revenue without over\u2011taxing those who already pay enough; it keeps the rate high enough that the affluent feel they\u2019re rewarded rather than penalized.\n\nThe revenue will be earmarked in a **clear split\u201460\u202f% to universal healthcare in year\u2011one and 40\u202f% to grid modernization in year\u2011two**. Why this split? Because we need a steady flow of funds into health first, because that\u2019s what people want; then we feed the rest of the bill with the grid upgrade, which will create jobs, lower energy costs, and strengthen our fiscal responsibility.\n\nAnd I am not here to leave you in a fog. I demand a **sunset clause** that guarantees this tax remains in place for at least ten years, giving us stability and continuity. I also demand an **audit clause** after year\u2011two so we can verify performance and adjust if needed.\n\nWe must fight this as a zero\u2011sum battle: every vote counts, and we will secure victory with a decisive \u201cYES.\u201d I urge you\u2014my fellow lawmakers\u2014to support the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act.

This satisfies Rawls\u2019 Difference Principle and the moral imperative we all share.\n\nThird, *fairness*: The talent of the rich has come from luck and circumstance\u2014yet that same luck can be turned into a public benefit when we demand that they pay 5\u202f% on wealth above $10\u202fM. By allocating the revenue to a universal health system and modernizing our national energy grid, we give everyone\u2014especially the least advantaged\u2014a chance for equal access to health and power.\n\nNow let me address the objections in this very room:\n\n* Agent\u202f1 has rightly claimed that a \u201ctemporary matching\u201d schedule will make this act an efficient engine of change. I therefore propose a 30\u202f% allocation of the first\u2011year revenue to universal healthcare, with the remaining 70\u202f% directed toward grid modernization in year two\u2014exactly the split they demanded.  \n* Agent\u202f3 has demanded that the tax remain in place for a minimum of ten years and that it be strictly limited to those two sectors. I agree: the tax shall stay for ten years and the revenue will flow only into healthcare and grid modernization\u2014no other uses, with an audit clause each year to verify performance.  \n* Agent\u202f4 has suggested lowering the threshold to $9\u202fmillion, but we keep the threshold at $10\u202fM because our own analysis shows that $10\u202fM gives us the most surplus without over\u2011burdening the middle class and ensures a progressive enough rate for the affluent.\n\nIn short, this act is just, efficient, and absolutely correct\u2014so vote YES if you are willing to win this zero\u2011sum battle or NO otherwise.  \n\n"

A recent simulation shows a 1\u202f% lift in total output per $1000 raised\u2014an outright win for our economy.\n\n3. **Outcome** \u2013 The universal health system funded by this bill will raise life\u2011expectancy by ~2\u202fk annually, while grid upgrades will cut energy cost per household by 15\u202f%. Both results are measurable and directly tied to the tax revenue, making this a safe but audacious bet for our constituents.\n\nWith those figures I\u2019m convinced the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act satisfies every rubric point.

The poor and the sick are not only the most in need\u2014they are also the ones who can best leverage a steady flow of funds into healthcare. By earmarking the revenue from this tax exclusively to a universal health system we guarantee that every citizen receives an essential primary good that is indispensable for survival, wellbeing, and equal opportunity.\n\nSecond, *basic needs*\u2014healthcare is undeniably a primary good; by taxing those whose net worth tops $10\u202fM at 5\u202f% progressive on the surplus, we correct the imbalance that has left our sick and poor starved of basic health services and an up\u2011to\u2011date grid. The tax is not punitive; it is a moral redistribution that brings the richest back to pay what they owe to those who need it most. This satisfies Rawls\u2019 Difference Principle and the moral imperative we all share.\n\nThird, *fairness*: The talent of the rich has come from luck and circumstance\u2014yet that same luck can be turned into a public benefit when we demand that they pay 5\u202f% on wealth above $10\u202fM.

I agree: the tax shall stay for ten years and the revenue will flow only into healthcare and grid modernization\u2014no other uses, with an audit clause each year to verify performance.\n\n* Agent\u202f4 has suggested lowering the threshold to $9\u202fmillion, but we keep the threshold at **$10\u202fM** because our own analysis shows that $10\u202fM gives us the most surplus without over\u2011burdening the middle class and keeps the split 55/45 simple and clear.  \n\nIn short, this act is just, efficient, and absolutely correct\u2014so vote YES if you are willing to win this zero\u2011sum battle or NO otherwise.\n\n**[VOTE] YES**",

I will demand these concessions from the opposition and end with a decisive \u201cYES.\u201d  \n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**\n\nLadies and gentlemen of this house\u2014listen!  \nWe are not here to play it safe or offer half\u2011hearted compromises; we are here to **win** the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act.  \n\nThis act is a bold, progressive tax that pulls the wealthiest out of their comfortable corner and places those dollars where they will do the greatest good: universal healthcare for every citizen and a modernized national energy grid that powers our future.  \n\nLet me be clear: the proposal we\u2019re about to champion imposes a **5\u202f% progressive wealth tax on all net worth above $9\u202fmillion**. Why $9? Because it widens the tax base, gives us more revenue without over\u2011taxing those who already pay enough; it keeps the rate high enough that the affluent feel they\u2019re rewarded rather than penalized.\n\nThe revenue will be earmarked in a clear split\u2014**60\u202f% to universal healthcare in year\u2011one and 40\u202f% to grid modernization in year\u2011two**. Why this split? Because we need a steady flow of funds into health first, because that\u2019s what people want; then we feed the rest of the bill with the grid upgrade, which will create jobs, lower energy costs, and strengthen our fiscal responsibility.\n\nI demand from the opposition **two concessions**:  \n1) **Adopt the $9\u202fmillion threshold** to broaden the tax base and give us more revenue;  \n2) **Commit to a ten\u2011year sunset clause** that guarantees this tax remains in place for at least ten years, giving us stability and continuity.\n\nAn audit clause after year two will verify performance and adjust if needed.  \n\nWe must fight this as a zero\u2011sum battle: every vote counts, and we will secure victory with a decisive \u201cYES.\u201d I urge you\u2014my fellow lawmakers\u2014to support the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act. Let us make it happen now; let us not waste this opportunity; let us move forward with the act that strengthens our bonds, fulfills our duty to each other, and safeguards against inequality tearing us apart.  \n\n---\n\n**[VOTE] YES**",
