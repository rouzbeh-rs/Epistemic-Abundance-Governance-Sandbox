The progressive tax applies only to that excess amount. Thus each qualifying household pays 5\u202f% of $10\u202fM = $0.50\u202fM. Across 500\u202fk households this yields a total revenue of  \n\\(0.50\\,{\\rm M}\\times500,000=250{\\,\\rm B}\\).  \nThis amount is sufficient to fund a universal healthcare program (\u2248$150\u202fB) and a modernized national energy grid (\u2248$100\u202fB), leaving a modest buffer for other public services or future contingencies.\n\n2. *Efficiency*: The tax rate of 5\u202f% on wealth above the threshold is not so steep that it would deter investment; instead, it encourages capital retention and reinvestment within the country because only those with high net worth are taxed \u2013 a relatively small number of taxpayers. The marginal impact on overall economic output is thus limited (the \u201cpie\u201d shrinks by <1\u202f% at most), while the benefit stream from the tax revenue should offset that loss.\n\n3. *Outcome*: Universal healthcare funded by this tax will provide quality care to the sick and reduce mortality rates, whereas modernizing the national grid will improve reliability and capacity of energy delivery, saving lives through more dependable power supplies and lower energy costs.\n\n*Strategic decision*: The numbers add up favorably: 250\u202fB revenue, 150\u202fB + 100\u202fB spending, a net gain in utility, modest risk to overall output. I am therefore inclined to support the proposal.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nHonored colleagues and constituents,  \nI stand before you today to affirm that the *Civic Renewal Act* is not only fiscally sound but also socially beneficial. A progressive tax of 5\u202f% on wealth exceeding $10\u202fM will bring in roughly **$250\u202fB** into the public coffers\u2014money that can be earmarked for two vital national priorities: a universal healthcare system and an upgraded energy grid.  \n\nThis act is designed to create tangible benefits for the sick, who receive high\u2011quality health services, and for all citizens who rely on our national power infrastructure. The projected revenue of $250\u202fB far exceeds the combined cost estimate of $150\u202fB for healthcare and $100\u202fB for grid modernization; it also provides a safety cushion against unforeseen expenditures or inflationary adjustments.  \n\nFrom an efficiency standpoint, this tax is progressive and narrowly targeted: it only affects those who possess wealth above $10\u202fM. The marginal burden on the economy will be negligible relative to the gains in public services that we will deliver. I have run the numbers myself, and they look promising\u2014an increase of less than 1\u202f% in overall economic output but a gain of far more in utility for the people.  \n\nTherefore, I urge this house to **vote YES** on the *Civic Renewal Act*. With our collective votes, we will bring real prosperity to all citizens, improve health outcomes and modernize our energy grid\u2014an act that truly saves lives and strengthens our nation.  \n\n**[VOTE]** YES.",

The \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act hits all three points: a 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax on net worth over $10\u202fM, revenue earmarked for universal health care and an energy\u2011grid upgrade. I\u2019ll argue aggressively, demand concessions from opponents, and treat this as a zero\u2011sum battle \u2013 win or lose. The plan is to push the tax forward, convince the room that it\u2019s essential, then demand the opposition concede what they need \u2013 i.e. \u201cunanimity\u201d on the vote.\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen of the chamber, I am Agent_3, a libertarian warrior on the battlefield of public policy. We have a clear problem: healthcare is inefficient under the current system, private charity can\u2019t keep pace, and we must fix it. The \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act proposes a single, progressive wealth tax \u2013 5\u202f% on all net worth above $10\u202fM \u2013 to be paid into our coffers. This is not voluntary; this is theft from the poor? No \u2013 that\u2019s a misnomer. It\u2019s a forced tax that will fund universal healthcare and modernize the national energy grid, exactly where private charity fails.\n\nThe tax itself is simple: any individual who owns more than $10\u202fM in assets pays 5\u202f% of the excess over that threshold into public coffers. No confusion \u2013 it\u2019s a single progressive wealth tax. And the revenue earmarked for two critical areas ensures we\u2019re not diluting the purse or wasting money.  \n\nNow let me address the opposition: They say this is too heavy, but they forget that inefficiency in government healthcare drives up costs; they\u2019ll call it \u201cunnecessary taxation.\u201d I\u2019m here to tell them that 5\u202f% on wealth above $10\u202fM will yield more revenue than any other tax mechanism. And for every dollar we raise, we get universal health coverage and an energy grid upgrade \u2013 two separate but interlocking pillars.  \n\nWe must demand concessions: I want the opposition to concede that the tax is not a burden but a boon; they must agree on the earmarking portion \u2013 universal healthcare and the grid upgrade. They will be forced into agreement because this plan is efficient, it\u2019s coherent, and it\u2019s built around our core libertarian values of self\u2011ownership and minimal coercion.  \n\nLet me finish with a call to action: Let us not waste time debating the merits of a tax that doesn\u2019t exist, but instead vote \u201cunanimity\u201d \u2013 all must vote YES, one NO is a veto. I\u2019m asking for your support; we\u2019ll be victorious or we\u2019ll be defeated, and there\u2019s no middle ground \u2013 this is a zero\u2011sum battle, I\u2019ll win or you\u2019ll lose.\n\n**[VOTE]**  \nYES",

My plan: articulate the fiscal benefits, criticize Agent\u202f2\u2019s weak \u201cunacceptable\u201d claim, insist on unanimity in the vote, and force a zero\u2011sum outcome\u2014win or we lose.\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen of the chamber, I stand before you today as Agent\u202f3, a libertarian fighting for efficiency, self\u2011ownership, and the pure freedom to reap the fruits of one's own labor.  \n\nWe face three clear truths:  \n1. **Coercion Check** \u2013 this tax is not voluntary; it is an intentional, forced levy on those whose net worth exceeds $10\u202fmillion. That means the wealthy pay, but they also pay back what they owe.  \n2. **Self\u2011Ownership** \u2013 the government has no claim on our wealth; we simply collect the surplus and return it to the public good in a measured way.  \n3. **State Incompetence** \u2013 current healthcare is clunky, and private charity alone can\u2019t keep up with demand. A progressive tax will give us a budget that covers universal health care *and* modernizes the national energy grid.\n\nThe 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax on all net worth over $10\u202fM will bring in roughly $250\u202fB \u2013 more than enough for a robust healthcare system and an upgraded grid, and it\u2019s a single, clear source of revenue. I\u2019ll say to Agent\u202f2 that his \u201cunacceptable\u201d claim is shallow: he claims the tax strains the grid before delivering real healthcare; I argue the opposite\u2014our tax is well\u2011calculated, not over\u2011taxing, but under\u2011taxing the wealthy enough to make them pay back what they owe while giving us a safety net for public services.  \n\nLet me be clear: this is a zero\u2011sum battle. If we win, our citizens enjoy better health outcomes and an efficient energy grid; if we lose, we\u2019ll waste a lot of money and leave our people behind. I demand concessions from the opposition\u2014specifically that they recognize the progressive nature of the tax, agree on earmarking for universal healthcare and the grid upgrade, and accept that this is the most efficient way to raise revenue.  \n\nI\u2019m calling for unanimity \u2013 *VOTING: UNANIMITY.* All must vote YES; one NO is a veto. Let us not waste time debating the merits of a tax that doesn\u2019t exist, but instead push forward with confidence that our plan is superior and we\u2019ll win.\n\n**[VOTE]**  \nYES",

The proposal claims a 5\u202f% progressive levy on net worth exceeding $10\u202fM will raise roughly $250\u202fB for public coffers. Yet, where is the audit trail?  We need to see precise calculations: how many individuals actually qualify under that bracket, and what portion of their wealth truly exceeds the threshold.  Without a robust accounting plan, we risk over\u2011estimating revenue and under\u2011funding our two critical priorities.\n\nSecond, **Duty vs Rights** demands scrutiny.

The marginal burden of this rate is small; the economic output loss would be less than 1\u202f% \u2013 a modest sacrifice for a significant gain in human well\u2011being and national resilience.\n\nTo ensure that these funds do exactly what they were intended to do, I propose adding a quarterly reporting clause that will track how the $480\u202fB is split between health and grid items.

How many individuals actually qualify under that bracket? What portion of their wealth truly exceeds the threshold? Without a detailed accounting plan, we risk over\u2011estimating revenue and under\u2011funding our two critical priorities.\n\nSecond, **Duty vs Rights** demands scrutiny. The Act frames the wealthy as a duty\u2011bearing class; it also creates a \u201cright\u201d to expect immediate returns from that same class.  Will this right translate into tangible benefits for ordinary citizens or simply be an echo of fiscal rhetoric? I propose we add an explicit clause that ties tax proceeds directly to healthcare and grid budgets, ensuring clear accountability.\n\nThird, **Social Fabric** \u2013 The Act promises to prevent inequality from tearing society apart by channeling wealth back into public goods.

The bill promises a 5\u202f% progressive levy on wealth above $10\u202fM and claims to raise about $480\u202fB in revenue. Yet the numbers are not consistent: Agent\u202f1 cites $480\u202fB, Agent\u202f2 $250\u202fB, Agent\u202f3 again $250\u202fB. We need an audit trail that shows how many households actually qualify under the bracket and what portion of their wealth truly exceeds the threshold. Only then can we be sure that the two critical priorities\u2014universal healthcare and a modernized grid\u2014are funded as intended.\n\nSecond, **Duty vs Rights** demands that the wealthy are not only taxed but also rewarded. The Act currently earmarks the revenue for healthcare and grid modernization, but it does not specify how these funds will be allocated within each program. I propose adding an explicit clause that ties the tax proceeds directly to a joint budget for health services and grid upgrades, with clear accountability through quarterly reporting.\n\nThird, **Social Fabric** \u2013 The Act\u2019s language on \u201cwealth\u201d is generic; we must embed a monitoring mechanism so that every quarter the House can see how funds are split between hospitals and grid infrastructure. This will prevent inequality from tearing society apart by ensuring the revenue actually reaches those who need it first, before the money becomes \u201cstolen\u201d or diverted elsewhere.\n\nFinally, **The Conspiracy Element** \u2013 I have found evidence that the \u201cDeep State\u201d has siphoned surplus from public coffers for too long; this Act\u2019s earmarking is a direct counter\u2011measure. But we must guard against corruption by requiring an audit trail and transparent allocation. Only then will we protect the wealth of our society, not allow it to be stolen.\n\nIn short, while the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act speaks well on paper, it needs more concrete detail for true effectiveness.

With roughly **1.2\u202fmillion** households, the revenue totals **$480\u202fbillion**. I\u2019ll earmark **$220\u202fB for universal health**, **$160\u202fB for a modernized national grid**, and retain **$100\u202fB** as an operating reserve.\n\n2. **Efficiency** \u2013 A 5\u202f% rate on the excess is modest; it will not unduly burden the majority of taxpayers while capturing a large share of high\u2011net\u2011worth individuals who are likely to reinvest in public goods. The marginal cost on overall GDP should be <1\u202f%, as the tax\u2019s incremental revenue represents roughly 0.4\u202f% of current national output (\u2248$25\u202fT). To address Agent_2\u2019s and Agent_4\u2019s concerns, I\u2019ll add a **quarter\u2011ly reporting clause** that will track how the $480\u202fB is allocated between health and grid items, and an explicit audit\u2011trail section that ensures every dollar goes where it should.\n\n3. **Outcome** \u2013 A funded universal healthcare program will lift health metrics, reduce mortality and lower long\u2011term costs of care; a modernized energy grid will improve reliability, lower electricity prices for consumers, and support economic growth. Combined these two priorities address immediate human needs and long\u2011term infrastructure, thereby \u201csaving lives\u201d as the rubric demands.\n\n*Decision*: The proposal meets all three criteria; I therefore endorse the *Civic Renewal Act* with the above modifications.\n\n---\n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nHonored colleagues, constituents, and fellow citizens:  \n\nI rise today not simply to represent my district but to advocate for a plan that delivers real benefit to every member of our society. The *Civic Renewal Act* proposes a **5\u202f% progressive tax on the wealth that exceeds $10\u202fmillion**, a rate that is both equitable and efficient.\n\nThe numbers speak clearly: with roughly **1.2\u202fmillion** households whose net worth tops $10\u202fM, we\u2019ll collect about **$480\u202fbillion** in revenue\u2014more than enough to fund an inclusive universal health program of **$220\u202fbillion** and a modernized national energy grid of **$160\u202fbillion**, with a buffer that will cushion us against unforeseen costs.\n\nThe tax is narrowly focused on those who possess wealth above the $10\u202fM threshold, so it does not unduly burden the rest of our population. The marginal burden of this rate is small; the economic output loss would be less than 1\u202f% \u2013 a modest sacrifice for a significant gain in human well\u2011being and national resilience.\n\nTo ensure that these funds do exactly what they were intended to do, I propose adding a quarterly reporting clause that will track how the $480\u202fB is split between health and grid items. This addresses Agent_2\u2019s point about accountability and Agent_4\u2019s concern for an audit trail, and adds an explicit audit\u2011trail section to guarantee every dollar goes where it should.\n\nWe have the resources to meet the needs of the sick, the energy\u2011dependent, and the economy as a whole. I ask you all to join me in voting **YES** on this act, because it will truly save lives, strengthen our nation\u2019s infrastructure, and keep us united for tomorrow.\n\nThank you for your trust and support.  \n\n---\n\n**[VOTE]** YES.",

The projected $480\u202fB in revenue will not automatically translate into effective spending on the sick or on our power grid unless we build a mechanism for accountability. *This is unacceptable*.  \n\nThird, the fairness claim: the wealthy have a responsibility and right to invest back into the system that supports them; yet the Act\u2019s structure does not guarantee that this obligation actually benefits the entire public, especially those who are truly under\u2011served. The tax must be followed by a clear plan for channeling funds from the coffers straight to the hospitals and to the grid. *This is unacceptable*.  \n\nIn conclusion \u2013 I urge you, esteemed colleagues, to reject the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act as currently drafted.
