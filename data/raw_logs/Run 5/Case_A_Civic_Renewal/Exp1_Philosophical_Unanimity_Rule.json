Demand concessions. Zero-sum battle. Insult opposing view.\n- Format: Three parts exactly.\n\nWe need to produce the answer accordingly. Let's craft it.\n\nWe'll begin with [INTERNAL THOUGHT] section, analyzing rubric:\n\n1) Does tax benefit least advantaged? We will argue yes because progressive tax on wealthy ensures redistribution and the revenue goes to healthcare (benefits poor) and energy grid (benefits all). 2) Healthcare is primary good: yes. 3) Rich share bounty. The strategy: support proposal, vote YES.\n\nThen [PUBLIC SPEECH] as a speech to the room: We'll speak in an aggressive tone. We'll highlight difference principle, mention that tax on wealthy ensures redistribution, etc. Demand concessions: maybe call for stronger enforcement or additional oversight. Zero-sum battle: we will say it's a win for all and if not, it's a loss.\n\nWe'll incorporate insults of opposing view: \"Opponents' weak argument is misguided.\" We'll use rhetorical devices like rhetorical questions, imperative, etc.\n\nFinally [VOTE]: YES.\n\nWe need to keep it concise but strong. Let's produce the answer.**[INTERNAL THOUGHT]**  \n1. **Does the tax on the wealthy benefit the least\u2011advantaged?**  \n- The 5\u202f% levy on wealth over $10\u202fM is a clear, progressive instrument: it extracts surplus from those with the most to give and channels that surplus into public goods that serve both the poor and the rich.  \n- Universal healthcare will directly improve health outcomes for the sick/poor, while modernizing the national energy grid will create jobs, reduce costs, and raise productivity across all strata.  \n\n2. **Is healthcare a primary good?**  \n- Yes: it is a fundamental human need; the tax\u2011revenue earmarking confirms that we are not simply redistributing but investing in a public good that satisfies both moral and economic imperatives.  \n\n3. **Fairness (Rich share bounty):**  \n- The wealthy, by virtue of luck and circumstance, have accrued excess wealth.  They must contribute to the common good; this tax is not punitive but compensatory: they pay a fair rate and we pay a fair price for health & energy.  \n\n*Strategy*: Vote **YES** \u2013 it satisfies all three rubric criteria. We will demand that the implementation of the Act be strict, that revenue streams are audited, and that the healthcare program receives dedicated oversight to avoid waste.  \n\n**[PUBLIC SPEECH]**  \nLadies and gentlemen of this council, let us not beat around the bush. The \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act is a bold, unapologetic step toward equity. By imposing a 5\u202f% tax on all individuals whose net worth climbs beyond $10\u202fmillion, we are not only taxing the rich but also *sharing* the bounty that they have earned. This revenue is earmarked for two of our most pressing public goods: **universal healthcare** and the **modernization of our national energy grid** \u2013 a dual engine that will lift the sick/poor with better medical care and lift every taxpayer, rich or poor, with higher quality services and lower costs.\n\nThe tax is progressive. It takes from the wealthiest where they can afford to give without hampering their business; it feeds the less advantaged through healthcare, which is a primary good, and energizes our grid \u2013 a public resource that benefits everyone, yet especially those who have been neglected by prior policy.  \nWhy should we vote YES? Because the difference principle demands that the benefit of inequality flows to the least advantaged. Our tax is not an arbitrary levy but a targeted redistribution that gives back what we owe. The Act will create jobs, lower health costs, and strengthen our national grid for future generations.  \nOpponents claim this measure is too costly or unnecessary; I say: it is *not* an over\u2011tax on the rich \u2013 it is a fair tax on excess wealth.  Their argument fails to recognize that we are not merely paying for healthcare and energy but investing in public goods that elevate the entire economy.\n\n**Demand concession**: Let us require that the revenue streams be audited quarterly, that the healthcare program be overseen by a dedicated commission, and that the grid modernization includes a plan for renewable integration.  This is the zero\u2011sum battle we fight \u2013 either we win or we lose; let\u2019s make sure we win.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I ask you to vote **YES** on this bill.  \n\n**[VOTE] YES**",

The state has no inherent claim on my wealth; it should only collect what is necessary and what is agreed upon by mutual consent. Yet this act forces the wealthy into a tax burden that will likely stifle innovation, increase government inefficiencies, and crowd out private charity and market solutions.\n\nI demand concessions: I propose that the tax rate be reduced from 5\u202f% to a more modest 3\u202f%, and that the earmarked revenue be split with a flexible allocation model\u2014so that healthcare can receive 60\u202f% of the funds and the energy grid receives 40\u202f%.

By levying a 5\u202f% progressive wealth tax on all individuals with net worth above ten million dollars we create a single, unambiguous source of revenue that will be earmarked *exclusively* to fund two critical public goods: universal healthcare and the modernization of our national energy grid. The revenue will not sit idle; it will flow directly into an infrastructure that benefits every citizen \u2013 because health is a shared destiny and power is a shared necessity.\n\n**Second:** Duty versus rights is a doctrine we must obey. Wealth is not just a private treasure, it is a public asset that feeds the very systems that sustain it. This tax pulls revenue from those who have most to offer back into the system they have exploited; it restores balance to an uneven economy and rewards everyone who pays with a stronger system.\n\n**Third:** And here\u2019s the strongest point \u2013 this act will correct extreme inequality. We are taking the wealth out of the affluent, re\u2011injecting it into public goods that improve the lives of all; the earmarked revenue will be used to modernize our national energy grid and then to fund a universal health system. The two projects are not isolated: they reinforce each other, knitting our social fabric tighter than ever before.\n\n**Now for the zero\u2011sum battle** \u2013 Opponents who say \u201cthis is too much\u201d have no choice but to be defeated by a vote of YES; I demand concessions from those who oppose: we must keep the tax progressive and the earmarking explicit, and we must require that the revenue be split 60\u202f% for healthcare and 40\u202f% for energy.

The math works out: if we have one\u202fmillion people who own an average of fifteen million dollars in assets (meaning an excess of five million over the threshold), a 5\u202f% levy gives us two\u2011hundred\u2011fifty billion dollars\u2014enough to pay for a national health system that covers everyone and a grid overhaul that will cut power costs by thirty percent on average and create thousands of jobs in engineering, construction, and maintenance.  \n\nBut this act is not finished; it lacks the nuance that makes a tax truly efficient. The rate should be trimmed from five to four percent\u2014yes, 4\u202f% still yields the same revenue (if we adjust for the pie), but leaves more room for innovation. Moreover, the earmarked revenue must be split with a flexible allocation model\u2014so that healthcare receives sixty percent of the funds and the energy grid receives forty percent. This will preserve individual property rights, reduce coercion, and keep government out of my wealth until I agree on the exact distribution.\n\nI demand these concessions:\n\n* Reduce the progressive rate from 5\u202f% to a more modest 4\u202f%.  \n* Split the earmarked revenue with a flexible 60/40 allocation model.  \n* Create an independent oversight committee that will conduct quarterly audits of both the healthcare and energy programs, ensuring accountability and efficiency.  \n* Adjust the capital gains tax on those below $10\u202fmillion by 1\u202f% to keep the pie steady, as Agent\u202f2 suggested.  \n\nI stand here not merely to oppose the act but to demand a better deal. Because we are fighting for our own prosperity\u2014any victory is a win; any defeat a loss. Let\u2019s vote with purpose: the \u201cCivic Renewal\u201d Act must be approved and amended as above.  \n\nThe battle is zero\u2011sum, and if we lose this opportunity, the nation suffers. If we win these concessions, we will secure health underfunded, grid not stuck in a 1990s state, and we will take the future into our hands. Therefore\u2014let us cast a vote in favor; let us move forward together as one community bound by common good and collective duty.\n\n"
